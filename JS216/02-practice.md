# comments on live coding with Erik (Sep 25, 2023)
- good framework for PEDAC
- great questions
- test cases:
  - great adapting the test case for integer
  - good add for negative sum
  - more test cases for smallest index?
- helper function naming? `isInvalidInput` better?
  - initially, I didn't understand your naming

- great - `isInteger`
- great - very structured, tested cases against algo
  - good catch on the duplicates, great to hear thinking

- good work going testing code in stages
  - inIdx - typo - didn't catch in push statement - great to test in stages


- track second index? good - part of algo
  - might need to worry about tracking second index?

- good work thinking through getting the smallest index - good exploration

- algo: start more high-level first?  would that help?
  - previously, were cautioned not to use code in algo


- for nested for loops:  start 2nd index after 1st index?

- inputs : need to track both starting coordinates *& direction*?
- great - defining coordinate system - might have helped to do a diagram?  work through an example?
- notes section?  could be good when your brain skips ahead
- good work to move on to examples

- careful with test case return values (can't check for equality on arrays using `===`)
  - good catch on object equality
- are test cases really exhaustive? Might have been easier to to 'unit' tests and then integration tests
- can do ALT-arrow key to move lines

- good catch, sorting out turning vs advancing in example, but it didn't seem as distinct / clear in algo
- language was a bit confusing: direction vs instructions
- 

- thought: declarative vs imperative
  - declarative : start [7,3,'N'] to end [7,3,'E']
    - this can be done in a number of ways - TBD
  - imperative : apply this, then that to achieve, etc.

(scramble problem)
- definitely use bullet points for pedac - should make it easier to refer to, also
- great clarifying - don't be afraid to take that slow;
- great reasoning on the empty str2 case

- I would call for loops more imperative (not declarative) - terms reversed?

# comments on live coding with Thomas Lane (Sep 29, 2023)
- good questions on types of characters - didn't create test cases for all possibilities

- in data struction, strings vs arrays : good consideration, good rationale
- spelling - iteratively, only 1 't'
- might be helpful to name things early to help with steps (otherwise, long form)
  - could have just mentioned 'every' method in approach?
- started coding at 22 mins, went back to algo at 24 mins
- finished at 41 mins
