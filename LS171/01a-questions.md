# Follow-up questions on LS170

- [ ] public and private keys: do these work in both directions? (e.g., CA signatures)
    - If I encrypt using a private key, can I also decrypt with that private key OR do I have to use the public key?
    - If I encrypt using the public key, can I also decrypt with that public key?
      - if so, couldn't I just fake the 'private' key encryption?
