# Follow-up questions on LS170

- [ ] public and private keys: do these work in both directions? (e.g., CA signatures)
    - If I encrypt using a private key, can I also decrypt with that private key OR do I have to use the public key?
    - If I encrypt using the public key, can I also decrypt with that public key?
      - if so, couldn't I just fake the 'private' key encryption?

 - [ ] MAC address - must be added by switches in the destination network, right?  so data primarily travels via IP address before it's packaged into a frame at the receiving network location?

 - [ ] does Ethernet transmission require a modem?  (i.e., similar to fiber optic, old-fashioned dial-up, etc.)
