### Lesson 1 quiz
- note the `def` (in code samples)! This implies return values are important
- need to review return values for various methods, etc
- e.g., what does `[array].each` return?

- need to be careful with loop counters and conditionals
  - *take the time to carefully review edges (start and end)*


### Lesson 2
- call `#methods` on a class or other object to see list of available methods (e.g., `true.methods`)
- remember:  short-circuiting:  `&&` and `||` stop evaluating once a return value can be guaranteed
- example of short-circuiting if `name` is `nil` then code won't evaluate `name.valid?` (a custom method) :
  ```Ruby
  name = find_name

  if name && name.valid?
    puts "great name!"
  else
    puts "either couldn't find name or it's invalid"
  end
  ```
  ---
- Ruby: everything is truthy **except** `false` and `nil`
  - `0` is truthy
  ---
==- local variables initialized within an `if` can be accessed outside of the `if`==
- `if` will return a value (based on what's evaluated)
- can use `[string].inspect` to see printable version of string w/ special characters escaped
- using `each` is considered a *declarative* way to solve problems (e.g., "find largest number in collection")
- using step-by-step (e.g., an iterator) is an *imperative* or *procedural* way to solve problems
