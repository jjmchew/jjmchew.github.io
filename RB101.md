### Lesson 1 quiz
- note the `def` (in code samples)! This implies return values are important
- need to review return values for various methods, etc
  - e.g., what does `[array].each` return?
    - `[array].each` returns the array it was invoked on *IF* given a calling block. If no block is given, it returns an Enumerator

- need to be careful with loop counters and conditionals
  - *take the time to carefully review edges (start and end)*

### Lesson 2
- call `#methods` on a class or other object to see list of available methods (e.g., `true.methods`)
- remember:  short-circuiting:  `&&` and `||` stop evaluating once a return value can be guaranteed
- example of short-circuiting if `name` is `nil` then code won't evaluate `name.valid?` (a custom method) :
  ```Ruby
  name = find_name

  if name && name.valid?
    puts "great name!"
  else
    puts "either couldn't find name or it's invalid"
  end
  ```
  ---
- Ruby: everything is truthy **except** `false` and `nil`
  - `0` is truthy
  ---
- ==- local variables initialized within an `if` can be accessed outside of the `if`==
  - variables will default to `nil`, no exception error is thrown for variables defined in unexecuted `if` blocks
  - `if` will return a value (based on what's evaluated)
- can use `[string].inspect` to see printable version of string w/ special characters escaped
- using `each` is considered a *declarative* way to solve problems (e.g., "find largest number in collection")
- using step-by-step (e.g., an iterator) is an *imperative* or *procedural* way to solve problems
- operator precedence <https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.1.2/doc/syntax/precedence_rdoc.html>
  - best to just use `()` to set precedence rather than rely on rules
  - `a = b = c = 3` or `puts a if a == b if a == c`: uses *right*-to-left evaluation
  - note: `{ }` has slightly higher precendence than `do...end`
  - e.g. 
    ```Ruby
    array.map do |num|
      num + 1
    end                         #   => [2, 3, 4]
    ```
    vs
    ```Ruby
    p array.map do |num|
      num + 1                   #  outputs #<Enumerator: [1, 2, 3]:map>
    end                         #  => #<Enumerator: [1, 2, 3]:map>

    # same as
    p array.map                 # outputs <Enumerator: [1, 2, 3]:map>
    ```
    (`do...end` is weaker, `array.map` gets bound to `p` first, then `do...end` block is passed:  `p` prints the Enumerator, but ignores / doesn't evaluate the block)
>
- regex integer number validation: 
  ```Ruby
  def integer?(input)
    /^-?\d+$/.match(input)
  end

  def float?(input)
    /\d/.match(input) && /^-?\d*\.?\d*$/.match(input)  # note \. is an escaped '.' 
  end
  ```
  - `\d` all digits
  - `^` start of the string
  - `+` 'one or more' of preceding matcher
  - `$` end of string
  - `?` 'zero or one'
  - `*` 'zero or more'
  - `.` matches any single character in regex (escaped in example above)
- `CONSTANTS` should be immutable
- Methods:
  - aim for 10 - 15 lines max, otherwise, split them up
  - if you display a value, don't return a meaningful value (i.e., not the intent of the method) i.e.:
    - return value with NO side effects **OR**
    - side effects with NO return value
    - e.g., don't mutate a collection while iterating through it
  - aim for similar levels of abstraction across all methods
  - should focus on 'what' to do rather than 'how'
    - e.g., `iterating_through_cards()` is a 'how', where `deal()`, `hit()`, `stay()` are all 'what' (actions)
- if variables and methods share the same name, then Ruby will access the variable first (unless `()` are used to explicitly call a method)
  ```Ruby
  hello = 'hi'

  def hello
    "Saying hello!"
  end

  puts hello # will output 'hi' unless you use   puts hello()
  ```
- methods cannot directly access local variables defined outside the method
  - methods cannot reassign local variables initialized outside the method
  - *blocks* can allow methods to access and assign local variables outside the method definition
- in Ruby: ==when an operation within the method mutates the caller, it will affect the original object==
- in Ruby:  numbers, boolean, `nil`, Range objects (e.g., `1..10`)  are immutable
  - assignment (`=`) doesn't mutate an immutable object, it creates a new object
- 'setters' (setter method):  a method defined by a Ruby object that allows you to change the value of part of an object (e.g., `Array#[]=` method)
  - these setter methods are **not** the same as regular assignment (`=`)
- Ruby is "pass by reference value" or "pass by value of reference" (a copy of the reference is passed to a method, which can then be used to mutate a mutable object)


### Lesson 2 quiz
- need to review whether loops are considered block:  Are variables initialized within loop scope available outside?  
  - ==NO== : having tested this, variables defined within loop blocks are NOT available outside
  - invocation of loops **do** use blocks
- does each branch of `if/else` have a separate, independent scope?
  - Propose no - variables defined within if/else are availabe outside so no new scope is defined
  - this is correct (according to quiz 2 answers)

### Lesson 4
- strings aren't true collections, each time you access a character (e.g. `str[2]`) a new object (and `object_id`) is created
  - in a real collection, each instance of `str[2]` would have the same `object_id`
- `Array#slice` != `String#slice`;  i.e., using `[]` to access individual parts of the 'collection' - they are similar, but return different objects (e.g., array vs string, respectively)
- when initializing hashes, keys should be unique - otherwise, value will get overwritten to the most recent
- accessing out-of-bound elements (i.e,. index > array or string length) or hashes without the indicated key returns `nil`
  - use `.fetch` if `nil` values might be part of data
- using negative indices will count from the *end* of the array or string
  e.g.,
  ```ruby
  str = 'abcde'
  str[-2] # => "d"
  ```
- `[array].map` does **not** modify `[array]` - if desired, need to use `[array].map!`
- for `hash["a"] = "ant"`, key will be a string, not a symbol
  - key is only a symbol if a symbol is defined (either explicitly using e.g., `:c` or through shorthand notation `{ c: 'cat' }`)
- e.g. destructive method WHILE looping: 
  ```ruby
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  numbers.each do |number|
    p number
    numbers.shift(1)
  end
  ```
    - iterator is acting on numbers 'in real-time' - i.e., acting on the changing array.  Index will increment predictably, but will act on the new elements of `numbers` array each iteration
    - i.e., output is:
    ```ruby
    1  # 1st iteration:  index 0 numbers [1,2,3,4], number 1
    3  # 2nd iteration:  index 1 numbers [2,3,4], number 3 (new index 1)
       # after 2nd shift, no index 2
    ```






### Debugging

Key steps
1. reproduce the error
2. determine the boundaries of the error
3. trace the code ('trap' the error)
4. understand the problem well
5. implement a fix
6. test the fix



### Rubocop
- `rubocop [filename]`
- `rubocop [filename] --format offenses`
- <https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/0.86/cops_metrics.html>
- disable rubocop rules for selected lines of code:
  ```ruby
  # rubocop:disable RuleByName
  Code that is raising a Rubocop offense
  # rubocop:enable RuleByName
  ```

### Pry
- need to `gem install pry`
- add `require "pry"` at top of file
- add `binding.pry` in code
- in Pry:  `Ctrl + D` to continue execution or `exit-program`
