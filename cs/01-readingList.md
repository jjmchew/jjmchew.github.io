## Notes

### Becoming a 10x Developer
- being "10X" is about making others around you 10X better, not yourself
- psychological safety is critical
  - people need to be able to speak up
  - feel that people will build off their ideas
  - be given benefit of the doubt
- amplify the voices of those who cannot amplify their own
- give credit where credit is due;  thank others
- give constructive feedback - NOT PERSONAL
- be accountable: do what you say
  - help others; ask for help if you need it
- maintain a growth mindset
- team productivity is the SUM of individual talents * teamwork
  - note multiplication factor of teamwork : the impact is significant

### Be Kind
- despite being right, what was most important is working with the team
- in business, everyone's job is to get things done and make an impact
  - doing anything meaningful past a certain point requires more than 1 person
  - you can't make a big impact by yourself - you **have to** work with a team
- being "...callously indifferent and on a long enough timeline ...is indistinguishable from being mean."
  - this is **not** being professional
- being kind is: taking responsibility for your impact on the people around you
  - being mindful of their feelings and considerate of the way your presence affects them
- **be responsible for how you make others feel**
- being kind is a long term strategy for maximizing impact


### How to communicate when trust is low
- trust is rebuilt by **small, positive interactions**
- "warning" is good - gives you time to slow down, be intentional:
  - e.g. "I want to say something, but am having a hard time with it"
  - e.g., "I have to say something, but I'm not sure how you'll take it"
  - e.g., "I need to tell you something and I'm anxious about your reaction"
- checking in afterwards is also good
  - e.g., "I'm not sure how that came across, could I have said things better?"
  - e.g., "Did that sound overly critical?  I'm not trying to dwell on the past, but I could use your help in figuring out a better way"
- don't let things stew - "clear the air"
- ask questions (be tentative)
  - e.g., "from my perspective, it looks like these results might be missing some data"
  - NOT "you're missing data"
- work hard to sound friendly - when trust is low, the lack of frills can be easily interpreted as rude or curt
  - emojis help a lot in written communication

- don't answer / respond in fight-or-flight mode
  - if you need time and people are waiting, it helps to indicate
  - e.g., "I'm still processing"

- try NOT to assume the worst
  - repeat what you've heard and share a potential interpretation
  - give people a chance to clarify

- engineer positive interactions, even if you have to invent them
  - create 5 positive interactions for every 1 negative interaction
  - look for chances to create positive interactions or it will be very difficult to only say negative things


- work hard to communicate positive intent and not create blame
- give people an opening to do better
- don't be afraid to call things out
  - e.g., "sorry to interrupt, but the story in my head is that you think that owning that number is part of my job and now you're upset with me..."
- try to resist reading layers of meaning into textual communication
  - **always ask for clarity**


### How to work together
- a lot of this video is based on the work of John Gottman (studied married couples)

- things to avoid when fighting
  - criticism : bringing other issues to bear on a single issue
  - contempt : intention to insult (making things personal)
  - defensiveness : not owning the problem
  - stonewalling : not engaging

- attachment styles:
  - know other people's styles
  - people tend to be 1 of the following:
    1. secure : comfortable with relationships (rare)
    2. anxious : need constant validation (most common)
    3. avoidant : tends to want more space (most common)

- universal needs vs personal needs (or situational needs)
  - support  (vs support from someone)
  - transparency  (vs being cc'd on every email)
  - etc.

- requests vs demands
  - requests are invitations to the other person
    - be specific
    - indicates what behaviour you desire
    - stay curious (e.g., do I need to re-frame?)


### Developing the Communication skills necessary for successful collaboration
- being a great communicator:
  - seek to understand before being understood
  - stays focused on true goal
  - grows from feedback
  - clarity & empathy
  - rigourous debate without hard feelings

- things we can do to help us grow as communicators
  - question & rewrite
    - e.g., question/think about our small reactions, and the narratives that we tell ourselves, think about our true motives (pride?)

  - observe
    - e.g., observe yourself,  watch good communicators

  - ask
    - ask for feedback (it's easier to get this way) and help

  - listen
    - don't think about yourself - just listen and absorb what other people are saying

  - learn
    - absorb and consume info and resources from other people

- remember that *you can grow* - you can change and improve
  - be self-aware: be vulnerable, be still and accept the things you notice
  - be goal-minded: stay focused on your true / meaningful goals;  not protecting yourself, etc.
  - practice: to do well in the rain, it's easier to practice in the sun first
  - trust: need to develop trust
    - communication builds trust
    - trust builds the platform for greater communication
    - be trustworthy, be authentic
