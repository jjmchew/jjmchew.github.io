# Crucial Conversations

## What is a crucial conversation?
- Opinions vary
- Stakes are high (can affect outcomes)
- Emotions run strong (can affect relationships)

- Having a crucial conversation reduces lag time between identification of problems and resolution


## The Fool's Choice:
- Thinking I must choose between kindness and candor (this is incomplete thinking)
- Should be able to be direct and respectful: work on telling the truth AND strengthening the relationship
- Focus on dialogue: the free flow of information and meaning b/w (2 or more) people
- Add to the pool of shared meaning
- Don't choose b/w silence or violence


## 1. Choose your topic
- Unbundle all of the issues
- Choose the topic (CPR): content (immediate issue), pattern (repeated issue), relationship (trust, competence, or respect impacts)
- May also need to talk about Process (how to provide feedback, have a conversation, etc)
- Simplify the topic: narrow the problem to a succinct statement

- Reasons we choose the wrong topic
  - We pick easy over hard (e.g., don't sugarcoat and pick easy issues if you think someone is incompetent)
  - Recent over right (e.g., if you're addressing long-term behaviour, don't get sidelined by someone talking about recent behaviour)

- Signs we picked the wrong topic
  - Emotions escalate
  - You walk away skeptical 
  - You feel like you've had the same conversation before

- If the topic is changing
  - Be alert
  - Place a "bookmark" (call it out and then return to it)


## Start w/ Heart
- Ask yourself: what do I really want for myself?  What do I really want for others? What do I really want for the relationship?
- Be aware our own motives can change in the moment: 
  - Also ask yourself, what am I acting like I want?
  - What should I do right now to move towards what I really want?

- Also ask yourself what you DON'T want to happen?

- Use what you want  AND what you don't want to consider a more specific question and avoid the Fool's Choice 
  - E.g., how can we have a candid conversation and strengthen our relationship?
  - E.g., how can I tell a peer my real concerns and not insult or offend them?
  - E.g., how can I talk to neighbour about behaviour and not come across as being self-righteous or demanding?


## Master your stories 
Path to action: we 
  - See and hear something
  - Tell ourselves a story 
  - Feel
  - Act

- Any set of facts can be used to tell an infinite number of stories, some of which result in negative emotions

- Be aware of your behaviour and feelings 
- Put that into words
- Analyze the stories
- Review the facts
- Tell the rest of the story: what have I not noticed? Why would a decent, reasonable, rational person do this? What do I really want?

Typical (bad, incomplete) stories: 
- Victim stories ("not my fault")
- Villain stories ("it's all your fault")
- Helpless stories ("there's nothing I could / can do")



## Safety in conversations
- people only dialogue when they feel safe
- for a true "safe" conversation, meaning must be flowing both ways; it's not just feeling "comfortable" : do you feel like you can share your meaning and have that meaning be heard, honestly and respectfully? If so, it is "safe"
- signs that safety is lacking: silence (masking, avoiding, withdrawing) or violence (controlling, labelling, attacking)
- be aware of the above behaviours in myself
- using virtual communication mediums, ask for more info (e.g., I haven't heard from you in a couple of days and I'm not sure how to interpret your silence. How are you feeling about the proposal?)


To create safety:
- create mutual purpose 
- mutual respect (care about others)

To rebuild mutual purpose:
- share your good intent
- apologize when appropriate
- contrast to fix misunderstandings (e.g., I don't want to criticize you or get on your case. I do want us to be able to talk about our concerns with each other so we can address them and build our relationship)

To build mutual respect (CRIB):
- C: (make) commitments (e.g. "it seems like we're both trying to force our view on each other. I commit to stay in this discussion until we have a solution that satisfies both of us")
- Recognize purpose behind strategies: separate strategies from purpose (e.g., going out and staying in are incompatible, but getting peace and quiet AND connect away from the kids can be compatible)
- Invent mutual purpose
- Brainstorm new strategies


## State your case (speaking persuasively, not abrasively)
- be confident (don't waffle)
- be humble (be open to other opinions and perspectives)
- skill (practice not making the Fool's Choice and look for a mutual path fwd)

STATE:
- Share your facts 
- Tell your story (I'm not sure if this is what you're intending, but I'm beginning to wonder if you don't trust me)
- Ask for others' paths (Can you help me understand? What's your perspective?)
- Talk tentatively (communicate stories and stories and not facts, be accurate, don't under- or over-state)
- Encourage testing (invite opposing views, play devil's advocate)


## Getting back to dialogue 
- be sincere
- be curious
- stay curious
- encourage others to retrace their path
- ask questions to understand (remember you are probably joining someone else's path that is already in progress - find out the when, how, what)

AMPP (keep doing this as conversation evolves):
- Ask questions 
- Mirror to confirm feelings (e.g., "from your response you don't seem ok)
- Paraphrase to acknowledge you've heard other stories
- Prime as a last resort  (e.g., like priming a pump, you may need to get water flowing before a pump works; "are you thinking that the only reason we're doing this is to make money and that we don't care about your personal lives?")

To solve disagreements (ABC):
- Agree - look for things that you agree on, don't be in "violent agreement"
- Build - work on the parts that you do agree on
- Compare - don't outright disagree, examine alternate perspectives (use STATE to illustrate a different Path)

- set expectations: e.g., "I can tell you're very passionate about this. I would sincerely like to explore and understand your point-of-view as I'm pretty sure it's different from mine. I'm committed to listening with an open mind. I wonder if after I've done that you'd be willing to listen to my point of view?"


## Receiving feedback
- neither content nor delivery is directly correlated with the harm people might receive from feedback
- perceived harm comes from thinking feedback threatens safety (perceived physical, social, material) or worth (self-respect, self-regard, self-confidence)

- examine your physical responses (e.g., are you hurt, scared, embarrassed, etc)
- understand the feedback
- recover (get a time-out if you need it) separate collecting feedback from sorting through it and deciding what to keep (e.g. "I will take more time to look at that and I will back to you")
- engage (acknowledge to others what parts are true and what you can do about it)

## Action
- decide how to decide
- e.g. command (autocratic), consult (get input from others, but make your own decision), vote (can save time if total agreement isn't necessary), consensus (best, but slowest)
- communicate the process clearly
- determine WWWF: who, does what, by when, how to follow-up
