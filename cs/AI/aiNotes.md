## Lesson 1: Intro to GenAI
- the main capability of LLMs is generating a text from scratch, starting from a textual input, written in natural language
- input = "prompt"
- output = "completion"

- LLMs predict output probabalistically
  - however, some randomness is added (temperature) : "non-deterministic"
  - for the same input, you don't get the same output

- prompts can include:
  - instructions (e.g., please summarize, create, write, etc.)
  - questions
  - a chunk of text to complete
  - a chunk of code and an ask to explain, document, generate more code, etc.
