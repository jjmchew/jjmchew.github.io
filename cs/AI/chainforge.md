- needed to add HF api key to send queries to Falcon model
- was able to add 2 custom providers (mirror and haystack)
- both worked well



## Comments
- adding custom providers was much easier
- code is simple, managed to incorporate haystack RAG pretty quickly
- interface seems a bit more robust (I didn't play around with it much)
  - interface and ability to easily export is also much cleaner
