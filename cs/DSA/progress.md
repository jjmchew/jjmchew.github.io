- Two-pointers:
    - familiar with start/end
    - have used anchor/runner (a little bit less clear on distinction with writer/reader)
    - tend to think in pointers as first default for problems
    - have trouble with details:  when to start / stop, when to move pointers in a loop, especially managing multiple pointers (e.g., may apply more to linked lists)

- Binary search:
    - Can generally implement
    - Had some trouble with finding a length of zeros in the middle of a sorted array of neg / positive integers (i.e., zero was neither positive or neg, but if there were no zeros, it would result in the middle pointer pointing to a positive number)

- Linked lists (LL):
    - generally comfortable with traversing LL
    - have trouble with modifying LL (e.g., removing nodes, reversing)
        - tend to have trouble keeping previous, current, head pointers distinct
        - sometimes I think I need a previous pointer, but then I realize I don't

- Dynamic programming:
    - still not 100% clear about the definition
        - i.e., optimized recursion (non-duplicated, memoized)
        - i.e., use of intermediate "totals" (calculations that can build up to the desired result)
    - this is a pattern I don't tend to think about
    - there may be many variations of dynamic programming - stay alert for other patterns and ways to use them

- Stacks / Queues:
    - haven't used these much, but generally familiar with concept
    - somewhat concerned about custom implementations of these: not sure that I can do this from memory and make it functional

- Binary Trees:
    - also a bit fuzzy - comfortable with the idea, but not much experience implementing with these
    - e.g., getting a random number from a binary tree seems like a tricky problem (thinking through actual probabilities for each returned number)

- Graphs:
    - also a bit fuzzy - concept seems familiar and generally understandable
    - need to work on implementation with these structures
    - I think about Dijkstra's but we may not need to know it for Capstone

- Backtracking:
    - no idea
