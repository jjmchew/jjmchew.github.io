# May 6, 2024 (Day 1)

- setting expectations:
  - problems can be difficult
  - use raise hand button, instead of chat (hard to see)
  - ask questions (no matter how trivial) : get clarification - someone can help
  - any struggles : DM (anything - DSA problems, team, etc.)

  - general schedule:
    - see google sheets
    - wk 1 - similar to LS220, but problems will be more difficult
    - wk 2 - will be new topics - more difficult, but less common on interviews
        - more recursion, etc.
    - at end of first 2 weeks - optional mock interviews (TBD on Wed)
      - peer-led : interview each other
      - encouraged to attend at least 1 : just for us to get exposure to interview setting, similar to ls215 / 216 interview, 109/119 interviews
      - problems won't be that difficult, but practice "performance"

    - wks 3/4 : Nick will lead
      - we'll work on a small project during those 2 weeks - totally different than DSA
      - pace / lectures are different
      - there will be aft/evening "homework", as well (not on schedule)


    - wks 5 - 8 : Max and Srdjan
      - week 8 - lots of take-home projects (similar to job hunt problems, get exposure)
      - week 5 - capstone research begins
      - week 8 - get project mentor
    
    - wk 9 onwards : work with project mentor

    - wk 15 / 16 : work on write-up
    - wk 16 : "personal artifacts" linkedin, github, etc.
    - wk 17: job hunt workshops, will get job hunt mentors
      - Nick will know more about job hunt;  mentors are typically available for 8 weeks (maybe 10 wks)


  - hourly schedule:
      - wks 1 - 4 are the same schedule
      - morning sessions 8 - 12 pm PST with morning break, usually around 9:45 - 10 am PT, lasts for 45 minutes
      - then group work etc. in afternoon
      - wks 5 - 8 : same morning session, 45 min break
        - afternoon session starts at 1 pm PT, 1 hr in week 5
        - week 6, we'll be divided into teams, may meet not every day

  - basecamp can be a bit painful
      - use a bookmark manager : bookmark basecamp links (e.g., notes, etc.)
        - e.g., could use an app "goodlink" (not free)
        - it may be hard to navigate links later

- hardest phases?
  - could be job hunt or capstone project
  - job hunt : takes skill - may need to do things that don't come naturally to you (e.g., outreach)
    - there is a lot of rejection - normal thing;  need to get past that and keep doing the work
  - capstone research
    - can be hard working in a team, making group decisions, etc.
    - picking a topic can be hard
    - it can be easy, but sometimes it can be hard
    - great experience to have for interviews
    - doing research together can be hard
  - algos / system design : can both be hard
    - these questions don't always come up in the job hunt
    - it depends on the student and the roles they're applying to
    - front-end roles don't generally get DSA problems
    - back-end roles generally have DSA problems
    - system design interviews don't always happen
        - more impt for capstone project (give you ideas about where to focus project)
  - capstone project will be used in every single interview

  - no matter where you struggle in capstone
    - getting a job is NOT just about technical skills
    - it's about technical AND non-technical AND work (e.g., outreach) that you do
    - it's more about being someone that people want to work with
    - through capstone, everyone should get the bare minimum of required technical knowledge
      - if you have a good problem-solving approach, it's a good thing
    - job hunt is a lot of NON-TECHNICAL factors

- good and bad news about first 2 weeks
    - these are tough weeks for most people
    - good news:  knowledge from LS220 and PEDAC is around 90% of the minimum in the previous cohorts
    - these 2 weeks are different now, with LS220 having most of the easy stuff, then what's remaining is harder relatively
    - need to work on binary trees and we'll be about 100% there
    - get as much as you can out of the rest of the material
    - minimum difficulty for interviews?
      - leetcode easy / PEDAC is minimum
        - "PEDAC" problem - a problem you don't need to use DSA strategies, speed will often be a requirement (e.g., need to solve 2 problems in 30 mins)
      - leetcode med is more common - you should be able to solve SOME of these problems
        - don't waste time on leetcode, since you won't always get DSA problems (don't grind through these)
      - don't worry about leetcode hard 

      - we may not be used to failing assessments : failure rate in med problems (i.e., solving without checking solution may be near zero, 5%, 10% - these are hard)
          - algos aren't about being smart, it's about recognizing patterns
          - if you haven't seen a pattern before, it's hard to solve it in an interview
          - in core (119), etc. nested loops - if you've never seen it, it may be hard to solve in an interview
          - don't get sad if the rest of your group can solve things and you can't;  don't compare yourself to your team or your cohort
            - COMPARE YOURSELF TO YOUR *PREVIOUS* SELF
            - our homework today is to gauge our current level of comfort
            - comparing yourself to others is not worth it - doesn't affect job hunt (algos don't make or break job hunt)
            - some companies have a language preference for interviews;  python was becoming more common in algo problems, hence the switch in capstone to use python for DSA

  - work on solving the problems yourself in the first 2 weeks
    - don't spend more than 50 mins trying to solve a problem
    - if you can't, look at the solution for the next 15 - 20 mins, then work on reverse engineering the solution (trying to understand the solution)
    - it's hard for people to accept this : it feels like cheating, or they get stubborn and will work for 12 hrs (and might not solve it anyway)
    - our goal is to be exposed to as many problems / algos as possible : better to see more algos than go deep in a single problem
    - set ego aside - learning is good!  (the ultimate goal)

    - try to solve it again in a few days without looking
    - don't let the best person presenting the solution for DSA all of the time
      - even if you had to reverse engineer the solution, your understanding can still be presented
      - everyone should present at least once per week, but better 2 or 3 times / week


- team issues
  - most common in capstone project research
  - reach out sooner - don't wait for things to escalate
  - don't use inappropriate language;  think of capstone as a workplace - be professional


- notes:
  - aside from HW, everything except HW, we will get detailed notes with visual walkthroughs
  - don't stress note taking - don't write notes;  it can be hard to make notes and watch / think about solution

- linked lists: 
  - recommend excalidraw - can be great for drawing
  - www.excalidraw.com


- etiquette - Srdjan - in general, likes camera on

- some problems will be "optional" - these are truly optional
  - probably haven't been given in previous cohorts
  - if you feel like everything is easy and you don't have anything to do, do these problems
  - if you're having trouble with HW, def don't do these problems

- if we're having trouble with problems
  - 50 mins for problem, thenm 15-20 mins reverse engineer solution, then group meet
  - in group meeting, whoever solves or understands the problem, they should explain to everyone
  - focus on the easiest solution generally - the *easiest to understand*

  - if you still don't get the problem after working through sol, group, etc. then reach out to Srdjan
  - Srdjan will walkthrough every problem the next day and we can ask questions about it

  - alternative approaches:
    - if you like pair programming, then do that
    - could meet with the team first to brainstorm, then work individually

- working in a team:
  - could use gather, zoom, discord, etc.
  - in lectures, breakout rooms will be created, Srdjan will do walkarounds and provide guidance

## video
- watch video, take a break, then meet with team for 15 mins to come up with questions about video, clarifications, etc.
  - with team:  stuff we agree with, disagree with, etc.
- HW will be tricky problems
- meet again w/ Srdjan at 11am PST (12 pm MST)
- video should be mostly review from LS220:  we won't revisit these concepts again

### discussion afterwards
- talking about Big O probably won't be a big part (i.e,. the hardest part) of the interview
  - the hardest part should be actually coding and implementing, typically not discussing Big O, etc.
  - we should know the common Big O associated with the patterns we implement

- in the video, the lady is interviewing for Google - notorious for difficult problems and try to trip people up
- we should all be able to walk through out thinking when coding and solving problems (from LS assessments)
- always explain the brute force - mention the easiest options if you're aware of them
  - an interviewer won't know that you know if you don't say
  - same with take-home projects - make sure you mention opportunities for improvement (if you had more time, e.g., adding more test cases)

- use helper functions - extremely important
  - doesn't just mean re-factoring to use helper functions
  - write the functions that you wish existed - e.g., "find all substrings"
  - this makes functions easier to test (since they're small in scope)
  - practice using helper functions
    - practice writing some tests for your helper functions
    - if the logic in your helper functions works
    - if the logic in your main function is sound
    - then everything should work

- LS recommended approach to solving DSA problems:  pattern recognition of common applications, etc.
  - populate your mental toolbox and pick the right tool for the problem
  - staring at code can increase anxiety; helpful to have a variety of approaches

- graphs are getting more common
- problems like implement a search algorithm are uncommon - hasn't come up in other cohort interviews

- use relevant variables for Big O - make sure not to use 'N' all the time
  - a very common mistake!

- review the LS220 problems and the assigned set; the problems already given to us put us at a level that is very close to where we should be for DSA interviews


#### Discussion about HW
- decide as a time on how much time we should spend individually before checking in together
- when you meet - present ANY solution (discuss and explain)
- then move on
- try and code the solution without checking the next day

- for leetcode:  don't worry about specifically optimizing to be too performant - different languages are more performant than others
  - add the testcases you fail to your test cases
  - probably no one is looking at your leetcode profile - it doesn't matter how many you submit
  - on some platforms, they won't show you the failing test cases, you need to figure out

- we will get the ALGORITHM, but we won't get the actual code
  - if we don't solve the problem ourselves, we should still try to code up the problem (every problem assigned) - it's good for muscle memory and for learning

- we're encouraged to work in a team as much as possible
  - that's Srdjan's preference
  - discuss solutions, bond, etc.
  - it's good warm-up for capstone project practice
  - it's best to be a team by the time we get to capstone project
