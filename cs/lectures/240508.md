- when asked about difficulty in implementing an algorithm in code
  - e.g., submit a solution that works for test cases, but another case comes up and it feels like I'm constantly chasing cases - 1 case breaks something else
  - Srdjan said:  if you can't implement in code, you don't understand the algorithm well enough



- 15-**3 sum** walkthrough
  - involves some tricks
    - used a large array for example: [-1,0,-1,-3,-3,-3,2,1,2,2]
    - sorting makes the array easier to work with
    - [-3,-3,-3,-1,-1,0,1,2,2,2] (deliberately worked with duplicates)
    - summary:  do iteration with 2 sum problem on the remaining array
    - for first element (-3) we do 2-sum on rest of array with target of 3 (needs to sum to 0)

    - 2 sum:
        - set start and end pointers
        - if sum > target: decrement end
        - if sum < target: increment start
        - if sum == target:  use the indexes as a triplet

        - to create a distinct triplet, 2 out of the 3 numbers must be distinct (to get the same sum)
          - first triplet: [-3,1,2]
    
        - when moving the pointers to get distinct triplets, you need to move start or end
          - for discussion, choose to move end pointer
          - while it's not the same, move e
          - ultimately, if start and end pointer are the same, then 2-sum iteration is over

      - when moving the first pointer (iteration):
          - need to move it until it isn't the same as the previous one
          - then do another 2-sum iteration

    - conditions:  no need to iterate the first pointer to 2nd last element
      - there aren't 3 numbers left for a triplet

    - first pointer needs to be the one to remove duplicates

- 3-**longest substring** discussion
  - most efficient hash structure for 'seen' characters is using index as value of that key
  - e.g., discussed the string 'hello'
    - when the hash value is the index, you can assign anchor to the past index + 1
  - e.g., discussed the string 'abba' (will be a bit tricky)
    - a b b a
      a   r       d = { a: 0, b: 1}  :  anchor will be updated to 2, update d = { a: 0, b: 2 }
          a r     at this point, only re-assign anchor if the d[chr] > a (anchor can't go backwards)

- **optional problem rooms II** discussion and walkthrough
  - rooms: https://gist.github.com/SrdjanCoric/a1db45b57f9bff74535529758793c144
  - premium problem (meeting rooms II)
  - need to have 2 arrays:  1 for tracking start times, 1 for tracking end times
    - both need to be sorted

  - e.g., [[1,15], [3,15], [5,20], [11,20] ]
    - start_times = [1, 3, 5, 11]
    - end_times = [15, 15, 20, 20]
    - all start times are less than all end times
      - thus, we need a room for every meeting
  
  - e.g., [ [1,3], [5,7], [9,11], [15,17] ]
    - start_times = [1, 5, 9, 15]
    - end_times = [3,7,11,17]
    - e.g., first start time - need 1 room
    - at next start time, it is bigger than first end, so can use the same room
    - check next start time and see if the previous meeting has already ended
  
  - there are 2 cases:
    - subsequent start time is greater than prior end time (ends up being 2 pointer problem)
  
  - start pointer increment all the time
  - end pointer increments when start time is greater than end time
  - increment rooms AS ROOMS are needed, if another meeting has ended, then a room is available - it doesn't matter WHICH ROOM
  - the start / end times are consolidated and sorted since it doesn't matter WHICH room is being used - all rooms are the same

  - algorithm:
    - pointer for start times 's'
    - pointer for end times 'e'
    - rooms = 1 (minimum)
    - start pointer increments each time - a new meeting
      - every time you increment, check start[s] vs end[e]
      - if start[s] > end[e], don't need a new room, increment e
      - if start[s] < end[e], increment room, increment s
      - if start[s] == end[e], don't need a new room, increment s

- 11-**container with most water**:
  - figuring out the strategy for this problem isn't obvious
    - sorted arrays tend to be good for start/end pointers
    - using pointers in this problem where the array isn't sorted makes it more difficult

  - we're using start/end pointers in this problem
  - the ideal scenario for the problem is that there is a large line at the beginning and a large line at the end
    - hence - it makes sense to use start/end pointers
  
  - e.g., [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
  - have a pointer at start `s`, then a pointer at end `e`
    - array of heights ,`h`
  - w = min(h[s], h[e]) * (e - s),  where w is water capacity
  - track the max of 'current water'
  - which pointer to move?
    - start or end?
    - move the pointer with the smallest height (increment or decrement as appropriate)
    - if the heights are the same, can choose whether to move start or end
        - can choose to move start

- 209-**minimum size subarray sum**:
  - walking through an interesting NlogN solution (not as good as previous solution, but interesting)
    - for NlogN, need to do some sort of binary search
    - tricky:  the array is random - unsorted, so how to do a binary search?
      - cannot sort, otherwise we will lose the order
      - usually binary search is for trying to find elements in an array
        - generally, to do a binary search, needs to know whether to go left or right - if there's no order, you can't pick a side for binary search
      - you don't need to do a binary search in the array
      - we are looking for a minimum *length* of a subarray
      - minimum possible length is 1, max possible length is 6
        - this is a *range* : we can do a binary search on the lengths, NOT the array

  - e.g., [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3], target 7
    - we pick a mid "length" - e.g., left = 1, right = 6, mid = 3
    - do a k-window slide to look for a sum which is bigger or smaller than the target
      - if it exists, update 'result'
    - then check for a smaller window
    - this is N log N since we don't search for lengths that are 4, 5, or 6
