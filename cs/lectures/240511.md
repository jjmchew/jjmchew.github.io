# May 11, 2024 (Saturday, Mock interview)

## comments on Tony's interview
- reading out loud - easy to follow along with what he was thinking
- good start with brute force method
  - convert to str to array, reverse, then compare
  - liked thinking about Big O ( checking palindromes )
    - a gap in test cases in brute force - good catch
    - time complexity N^2

- good job picking an examplex
- good job picking up on the hint and adjusting approach to 2 pointers
- went to code details really quick when figuring out algo steps
- great job on checking test case, finding errors
- great logic and rationale

- questions to ask:
  - reverse an array - linear time?
  - a faster way to do this?
  - talk about space complexity?


## my interview
- make sure I check all of the constraints - don't ask questions that are answered by the question / constraints
- it was hard to follow along initially since I didn't write anything down
  - written examples helped the interviewer a lot in understanding what I was doing

- keeping things high-level made it easy to pivot, especially with the "hash rabbit hole" (i.e,. trying to use a hash as a key for a dict)

- making a helper function for join was good (took less than a minute)

- review Python syntax for:
  - enumerate, join, in operator for checking keys
  - double-check falsy values - (i.e., 0 is falsy) so my initial seen hash check didn't work

- str is a function in python - don't overwrite that built-in function
  - don't monkey-patch it
  - be careful with variable naming

- might have liked seeing more testing of code as you go
  - it might make sense to test more often
  - but it worked out well, and I did test (which caught a syntax error)

```python

  # 49. Group Anagrams
# Medium
# Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

# An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

# Example 1:

# Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
# Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]


# Example 2:

# Input: strs = [""]
# Output: [[""]]


# Example 3:

# Input: strs = ["a"]
# Output: [["a"]]
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= strs.length <= 104
# 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
# strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

"eat" ==> { 'e': 1, 'a': 1, 't': 1}
"tea" ==> { 'e': 1, 'a': 1, 't': 1}

str_hash = { 'a': 4 }
- create string hashes
    - iterate through each char, if key doesn't exist, add key with count 1
    - if key exists, increment value (count)

- create new list with string 'hashes'

====================== initial hash idea ======================
seen = {}
seen[str_hash] = 0
seen[str_hash2]

- iterate through list of hashes
    - check if str_has has been "seen"
    - if so, add str to the output index nested list
    - if not, create new value list, add str (use index from position in 'hashes' - should correspond to index in original input)

output = [ ]
output[0].append(str)

===================== revised use of sorted string idea ============

strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
strs2 = [ate, ate, ant, ate, ant, abt]
          0    1    2     3   4     5
seen['ate'] = 0 (output index)
    - add to existing list:  
        output[0].append( strs[ index from strs2 ] )
- if not seen
    - increment output index
    - add to new output "group"
        output.append( [ strs[ index from strs2 ] ] )
