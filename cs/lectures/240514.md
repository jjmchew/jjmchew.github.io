- 55-**Jump Game**
  - https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/description/
  - will review the "greedy algo" solution - this is optimal
  - think about the problem as being what's the farthest you can jump?
  - iterate through the array and check if you can get to the end
  - farthest is the farthest index I can get to
  - it's a greedy algo since you only need to update the 'farthest' but you only update that if you need to
    - if it doesn't help, you don't need to update 'farthest'
  
  ```python
  farthest = 0  # initially farthest is 0

  for i in range(len(nums)):
    # if farthest is less than the index you can't reach the end
    if i > farthest:
      return False

    # update farthest
    farthest = max(farthest, nums[i] + i)

    if farthest >= len(nums) - 1:
      return True

  return False
  ```

## Stacks and Queues
- both stacks and queues are "abstract data structures"
  - means that you don't usually have them built into the language, you'd use some other data structure to create these
  - could use arrays or linked lists (usually a linked list)

### Stacks
- LIFO :  last in, first out


### Queues
- FIFO : first in, first out
- like a typical line-up
- enqueue:  add to line
- dequeue: remove from line

- you likely won't be asked to build a stack or a queue on an interview, but they are helpful to know
- you will use a stack or a queue to solve different problems
- problems that can be solved with stacks are usually better solved with recursion
  - queues and recursion don't work as well together
  - in an interview, can just use a list (array) as a stack or a queue
    - idea of pushing / popping will be helpful

- in python, you can use built-in versions in the "collections" module
  - you could also use a list
  - in Python, interviewers may prefer it, but it's not necessary


### Implementing a stack with a linked list
- you start with a node, with a value
- need a variable to hold a reference to the last variable in the stack, `top`
- `top = newNode`
- add a new Node:
  - `newNode.next = top`
  - `top = newNode`  (list will point "backwards" towards original node)
- remove a node (pop):
  - need to have a guard clause to make sure the stack isn't empty (i.e, make sure top isn't None)
  - `curr = top`
  - `top = top.next`
  - `return curr`
  - don't need to set oldNode.next = None since as top moves forwards, the nodes behind can't be accessed any more
    - the old node isn't deleted
    - generally, no one resets the next on the Node
    - to be detailed, you should set the next to None to support garbage collection

### Implementing a queue with a linked list
- you have a new node 'new'
- you need a variable to store the 'head' (the first person in line)
- you also need a 'tail' (you need to keep track of the tail with a singly linked list)
  - initially both head and tail point to the same node
- adding a new node:
  - tail.next = newNode
  - tail = tail.next
  (list will point towards tail in order, i.e., 1 points to 2, points to 3)
- dequeue (remove) a node:
  - head = head.next


- 20-**Valid Parentheses**:
  - https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/description/
  - use a stack
  - use a ref to match { (:), [:], {:} }
  - open parentheses : push
  - closing parentheses : pop last element
    - check if the last element matches the corresponding open parentheses
  - check if the len of the stack is empty

  - edge cases: encounter a closing parentheses with no match on the stack
    - return immediate False


- 71-**Simplify Path**
  - https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/
  - the trick is splitting the string into an array of char, split with '/'
  - cases:
    - "" : ignore
    - "." : ignore
    - "word" : append
    - ".." : pop unless empty ("go backwards")


## Trees
- **root** : a node without a parent
- **parent**: a node that has children, a relative description
- **children**: a node that has a parent, a relative description
- ***leaf**: a node that has no children

- a valid tree only has 1 root

- binary trees:  a tree where every node has between 0 and 2 children (incl.)
  - note:  an empty tree is also a binary tree
        - a single node can also be a binary tree

- binary search trees:
  - a tree where the left child less than the node, and the right child is greater than the node
    - and node value is <= max and >= min (or < node value, or > node value)
    - when we go left we update max to < parent
    - when we go right we update min to > parent

  - AND the left sub-tree is a binary search tree
  - AND the right sub-tree is a binary search tree
  - AND there are no duplicate values

  - i.e., every node in the right sub-tree must be greater than the parent
  - i.e., every node in the left sub-tree must be less than the parent


- building a binary search tree
  - create a node:
    - the first node can have any value since there are no other nodes
    - subsequent nodes must obey the restrictions on a binary search tree
      - all nodes to the left must be less than parent


- 98-**Validate Binary Search Tree**: https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/description/
  - need to use a helper
  ```python
  def isValidBSTHelper(node, min_val, max_val):
    if node is None:
      return True

    return(node.val > min_val and node.val < max_val and isValidBSTHelper(node.left, min_val, node.val) and isValidBSTHelper(node.right, node.val, max_val))

  return helper(root, float('-inf'), float('inf'))
  ```

## Recursive Definitions

### Boolean Value

The [Problem Name] is a [Data Structure] where [something is true] and the rest of the [Data Structure] is the [Problem Name]

The rest of the data structure in binary tree problems would be left and right children.

Example:

The Inverted Tree is a Binary Tree where node's left and right children are switched and the left and right Binary subtrees are inverted trees.


### Accumulate Values on Both Sides

The [Problem Name] of a [Data Structure] is [1] or [Value of Element] (possibly if something is true), [operation] the [Problem Name] of the rest of the [Data Structure]

Once again in Binary tree the rest of the data structure means left subtree and the right subtree

    Operation can be + or * etc.

    1 or value of element means that we are sometimes add the number 1 and sometimes the value of that node.

Example:

The Range Sum of a Binary Tree is the value of the node if it is between the high/low bounds plus the range sum of the left subtree and the range sum of the right subtree.

### Choosing Values Between Two Sides

The [Problem Name] of a [Data Structure] is [1] or [Value of Element] [operation] the [min]/[max]/[comparison] between the [Problem Name] of the Left [Data Structure] and the [Problem Name] of the Right [Data Structure]

Example:

The Maximum Depth of a Binary Tree is 1 plus the Max between the Maximum Depth of the Left Binary Subtree and the Maximum Depth of the Right Binary Subtree.
