- 1971-**Find if Path Exists in Graph** : https://leetcode.com/problems/find-if-path-exists-in-graph/description/
  - first step, need to convert list of edges to an adjacency list (will make life easier)
  - i.e., `{ 0: [1, 2], 1: [0,2], 2: [0,1] }`

```python
def validPath(n, edges, source, destination):
  def create_adj_lst(edges):
    adj_lst = {}
    for a, b, in edges:
      adj_lst.setdefault(a, []).append(b)
      adj_list.setdefault(b, []).append(a)
    return adj_lst

  def dfs(src, dst):
    if src == dst:
      return True

    visited.add(src)  # added
    for n in adj_lst[src]:
      if n not in visited: # added to prevent revisiting
        if dfs(n, dst):
          return True

    return False

  def bfs(src, dst):  # you can use either dfs or bfs - shouldn't make any difference
    queue = [src]
    visited.add(src)
    while queue:
      node = queue.pop(0)
      if node == dst:
        return True
      for n in adj_lst[node]:
        if n not in visited:
          visited.add(n)
          queue.append(n)

    return False


  adj_lst = create_adj_lst(edges)
  visited = set() # added
  return dfs(source, destination)  # could also use bfs

```


- first step creates `{0:[1], 1:[0]}`
- next iteration adds numbers to the existing lists (as appropriate)
- ends up as `{0:[1,2], 1:[0,2], 2:[1,0]}`

- dfs function as originally written creates an infinite loop of traversing the same nodes:
  - stack is originally `dfs(0,2)` (from problem)
    - neighbours of 0 are 1:
  - `dfs(1,2)`
  - `dfs(0,2)`
  - `dfs(1,2)`
  - ...
- in graph problems - this is a core issue (revisiting nodes)
  - fix it by tracking visited nodes
  - in Python, we'll use a set called 'visited'

- dfs vs bfs:
  - for this problem - it doesn't matter - just a matter of preference
  - for some problems, you must use 1 or the other;  it's just a matter of preference
    - you can do recursion with dfs or bfs with queue
  - BFS space complexity is better in the leetcode solution, but it shouldn't be that much better
    - for DFS space complexity is sometimes better
    - not sure why in this particular example there was a significant difference in leetcode stats


- set in Python is implemented as a hash behind the scenes - it is also O(1) lookup

- the solution above isn't the optimal solution - it's a "default" solution ("boilerplate")



- 200-**Number of Islands**: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/
  - this is a common problem for interviews
  - the grid given is essentially an adjacency matrix
    - when you encounter a land square:  do a dfs or bfs to find all connected land and mark them as visited
    - can keep that in a visited set
    - increment the count by 1 (you've explored 1 island)
```python
def numIslands(grid):
  rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  visited = set()
  count = 0

  def dfs(r, c):
    if r < 0 or c < 0 or r >= rows or c >= cols:
      return False

    if grid[r][c] == '0':
      return False

    if (r,c) in visited:
      return False

    visited.add((r, c)) # mark squares visited (and connected) are visited

    # order for searching below doesn't really matter
    dfs(r, col - 1) # go all the way to the left
    dfs(r - 1, col) # go all the way up
    dfs(r, col + 1) # go all the way right
    dfs(r + 1, col) # go all the way down

    return True


  def bfs(r, c):
    queue = [(r,c)]
    directions = [(-1,0), (0,1), (1,0), (0, -1)]

    while queue:
      # 0,0 is the first
      row, col = queue.pop(0)
      for dr, dc in directions:
        new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc
        if new_row < 0 or new_col < 0 or new_row >=rows or new_col >= cols or grid[new_row][new_col] == '0':
            continue
        else:
            grid[new_rol][new_col] = '0'
            queue.append((new_row, new_col))
```

- optimizations:
  - how to do this without a visited set?  it's increasing the memory
    - could mark land in place - just change the visited land to water
    - this modifies the grid in place




- 130-**Surrounded Regions** : https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/description/

```python
def solve(grid):
  rows = len(grid)
  cols = len(grid[0])

  def dfs(r,c):
    if r<0 or c<0 or r =-= ropws or c== cols or grid[r][c] != '0':
      return
    grid[r][c] = 'V'
    dfs(r + 1, c)
    dfs(r-1,c)
    dfs(r, c-1)
    dfs(r,c+1)

    for c in range(cols):
      if grid[0][c] == '0':
        dfs(0,c)
      if grid[rows - 1][c] == '0'

    # etc.  was not able to get the rest
```

- 994-**Rotting Oranges**: https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/description/
  - must use BFS and queue
  - every minute - 1 orange adjacent rots
    - oranges on every side rot - mirrors BFS
    - also needs to know whether an encountered orange is rotting from rotten orange 1 or rotten orange 2 (assuming multiple rotten oranges)
  - could count minutes - helpful to find the answer
  - could also count the number of fresh oranges - while iterating, this is also helpful

    0  1  2  3
  0 R  F
  1 F        F
  2       R  F
  3       F

  - to start - add (0,0), (2,2) to queue (rotten oranges)
    - then pull (2,2): add (2,3), (3,2)
    - etc.
  
  - to keep track of levels in bfs, keep track of the length of the queue before dequeuing
    - e.g., 
    ```python
    while queue and fresh:
        for _ in range(len(queue))
               # dequeu
               # rot new oranges
                  # decrementing fresh fruit
                  # append to queue
        minutes += 1
    ```

  - new example:
    0 1 2
  0 R F F
  1 F F F
  2 F F R

  queue: > (0,0), (2,2)
    - iterate twice:
        - dequeue (0,0)
          - rot adjacent oranges, decrement count, and enqueue
  - queue after first iteration (dequeue (0,0) ) > (2,2) (1,0) (0,1) 

  - queue after 2nd iteration:  (1,0), (0,1), (1,2), (1,2)

  - then next for loop (iterate 4 times on existing queue)
  - as the remaining oranges are rotted, nothing else happens
    - if we keep track of fresh count, then we can stop iterating once there is no more fresh fruit
