- talking out loud, great - "initial inclination"
  - use of BFS
- his "trick" - terminate on last level, only returning the left-most node

- spent a lot of time setting up the testing
- seemed to go straight to code, but great to see comments in code 

- questions:  could ask about space complexity (especially with extra arrays)
- great to see him call out the parts he was worried about

## comments to me about my problem
- good recovery
- good job talking through thought process - excellent, seeing errors, etc.
- writing out examples is excellent
  - hard to follow through examples when they weren't written
    - once I started writing - excellent
    - with so many variables, esp - just write everything out

- caught all errors - great explanation on why and where to fix
  - at the end and not making changes right away - great to think about (e.g., constraints of problems, etc.)
  - very deliberate - easy-to-follow

- Possible improvements:
  - need to think more about possible edge cases - need to work on that
  - could have prevented 

```python
from collections import deque
def list_to_treenode(lst):
    if not lst:
        return None

    root = TreeNode(lst[0])
    queue = deque([root])
    i = 1

    while i < len(lst):
        current = queue.popleft()

        if i < len(lst) and lst[i] is not None:
            current.left = TreeNode(lst[i])
            queue.append(current.left)
        i += 1

        if i < len(lst) and lst[i] is not None:
            current.right = TreeNode(lst[i])
            queue.append(current.right)
        i += 1

    return root

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

"""
Given the root of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.
ex1:
   1
 2   3
  5   4

Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5,null,4]
Output: [1,3,4]

Example 2:
   1
    3
Input: root = [1,null,3]
Output: [1,3]

Example 3:

Input: root = []
Output: []
"""

'''
- Traverse: NR
- return values ordered in a list
- modified depth first traversal:
    - only process Node and R child

Example 4:
       1
     2     3
       4     5
      6     

Example 5
     1
   2

Modified approach:
- BFS : start with right-most node first
- for each level, keep track of the first node on each level
    - add this to result list
- return result list
