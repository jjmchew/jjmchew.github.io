# May 20, 2024 System Design - Day 1

- weeks 3 and 4, we zoom out to everything else oiutside of the code - everything around the code
- some of what we talk about hasn't changed for 30 or 40 years - these are underlying concepts of distributed systems

- tech talks on Tues and Thurs at 1 pm PT / 2 pm MT - better for the whole team to attend on Tues and Thurs
- more homework these next 2 weeks - team exercises, videos, etc.
  - homework can feel overwhelming, we'll get focus areas - focus on those; don't stress the things you don't get
  - get the "gist of things" : some stuff we'll touch upon in successive days - this is the important stuff
  - approach everything with curiosity:  don't learn out of fear;  there is no clear-cut right or wrong

- this is the foundation for conducting our project research
  - each part of a distributed system exists to solve a problem, but that part will introduce a new problem - we'll get introduced to existing problem domains

- "production experience": experience working on a application live to external paying customers, could also be internal customers
  - implies sprints on cross-functional teams with other devs, PMs, UX, etc.
  - translate user stories, estimate time / effort
  - working on bug tickets, etc.
  - our project will not have paying customers, only a handful of people
  - we'll signal through our knowledge that we have experience working on teams and we have experience and we can learn
  - we might need to explain and describe what our capstone projects are  (i.e., not a dissertation, not a startup, not a company)
    - we should be getting more breadth here, we'll need to pick 1 domain (capstone project) to go deep

- we're getting prepared for system design interviews:
  - typically just a conversation or whiteboarding (diagramming)
  - little code in system design interviews
  - there are definitely wrong answers, but right answers are based on context / tradeoffs - need to understand requirements
    - need to justify decisions
  

## What is system design?
- does a project that we deploy to Heroku involve system design?
  - selecting a database and persisting data is a system design choice (e.g., choosing PostgreSQL)
  - using Heroku - mostly did all of the system design for us
    - we don't think about how many users were using our system
    - why can't these services do this for everyone?
      - data access patterns:  heroku is setup for common data access patterns
      - google/uber couldn't use heroku - very different than the patterns heroku has optimized for
    - using platforms
    - we'll gloss over cost, but it's a factor
    - lookup SaaS vs PaaS vs IaaS - helpful to disambiguate
      - more of a spectrum between out-of-the-box vs do-it-yourself
      - on-prem is "bare metal"
      - https://cmc-apac.sg/cloud-migration/iaas-paas-saas-cloud-computing/
    - digital ocean:  considered infrastructure as a service
      - VPS is IaaS
    - AWS has a variety of services along that spectrum

- common data access problems:
  - latency
  - downtime
  - response time
  - how your system is designed to handle amount and velocity of data
  - components:  need to think about how is database structured?
    - could think about data like water
    - the volume and path that flows through your system defines those choices
    - once you get a bunch of data, it's quite hard to change your system
  
  - e.g., think of bathtub as database
    - if you need to update the bathtub with the faucet running, how can you update your bathtub when it's already got water in it?
    - need to divert, create a secondary bathtub, divert water, update the old database, the migrate everything back
    - hence, always best to make decisions about db initially
  
  - why is changing an object in OOP code different than changing data in a database?
    - need to think about where data is stored and whether it's at rest or changing
    - it's not the type of data - code iteracts with the same type of code
    - with a database you can lose data, but with code, you might not lose data
    - OOP data is ephemeral
    - code is a sieve - water flows through code, but the data base is the actual store of data (if you lose that data, it's hard to get back)
      - database persists data
      - if we change what holds data, we might lose it
      - modifying code shouldn't lose data
  
-  e.g., existing db with single column 'name' : want to change this to 'first_name' and 'last_name'
  - an application upstream of the db populates that db
    - use SQL statements: e.g., `INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Nick Miller')`
    - need to update those statements to `INSERT INTO users(first_name, last_name) VALUES ('Nick', Miller')`
    - then need to migrate old users and separate name into first_name and last_name
    - need to change db and application code and doing both
    - application server is always on

    - when developing a new app you won't know much about your data access patterns initially, just need to make guesses
    - are tradeoffs appropriate?
    - need to express WHY it might be good
    - need to indicate why DIDN'T we choose other paths

- 
- 2 key criteria:
  - performance: the current state of application - how long it takes to load?
    - under 500 ms is optimal, less than 1 sec (upper bound)
    - the speed of a website is directly related to user attrition and UX
    - amazon study in 2006:  for every added 100ms of page load, lose 1% of revenue 
      - https://www.conductor.com/academy/page-speed-resources/faq/amazon-page-speed-study/
    - current state
    - affects all users
  - scalability
    - future state
    - an increasing amount of users and data

- need to be aware of key objectives in system design

## 3-tier architecture
- Note:  we're typically talking about these pieces as "conceptual nodes" vs actual physical hardware
  - the "node" can be thought of as a droplet : can change the physical properties later

- **web server**:
  - web servers are fast: lightweight and respond quickly
    - optimized to be the "tip of the spear" : handle as many requests as possible with webserver
    - should improve user experience since it's fast
    - can take load off application server: prevents us from having to scale application server (can delay adding complexity into the system)
    - can serve static assets
      - e.g., nginx: simple logic, like if/else statements for a place to look to serve files
    - can served cached content
      - can pick different criteria (e.g., cookies, users, request type, etc.)
    - can be "lock for front door"
      - e.g., blacklist IPs, headers, can add rate limiting (limit # of requests / unit time), etc.
      - prevents knowledge of app server IP address
    - can handle internet "overhead"
    - can proxy requests
      - **proxy**: means to redirect a request somewhere else
      - there are forward proxies and reverse proxies
        - forward: an internal server that forwards your request on to somewhere public
        - reverse:  a server that sits in front of 1 or many servers (a go-between app server and internet)
          - used for routing:
          - used for load balancing:
            - e.g., round-robin, or proxy based on most available resources / fastest response time / consistent hashing / etc.
          - load-balancing is a function of reverse proxy:  a reverse proxy has load-balancing capabilities

  - typically don't slice web servers more functionally
    - e.g., a single webserver to do SSL, another to do HTTP requests, etc.
    - instinct for webserver is often to vertically scale it
    - we're not going to talk about replication of web servers in this course

  - e.g., Nginx, Apache HTTP server, Webrick (Ruby)

  - includes proxy and load-balancer
  - is essentially good at the "front door" things that the application server isn't good at (see below)

  - tradeoffs (negatives to a web server):
    - generally don't consider additional latency of web servers (since they're designed to be fast)
    - additional configuration complexity (proxy, certbots, etc.)
    - a webserver creates a single point of failure (SPOF) that needs to be accounted for
      - webservers are designed to never go offline
        - some have built-in "hot" backups to limit downtime, etc.

  - webservers are typically just used in production
    - you wouldn't typically use a webserver in dev, unless you're trying to replicate a bug
    - webservers solve problems that arise in production


- **application server**: 
  - good at sending *dynamic responses* to requests
  - business logic to do something for each request
  - we don't want app servers handling all requests:
    - we don't want them processing static assets (e.g., images, etc)
    - adding/removing application servers + DNS (balancing load)
    - cached data
    - internet overhead: e.g., SSL encryption/decryption
    - e.g., being the "lock" for the front door: DDoS attack scenarios

    - 1. it's relatively expensive (loading an app) to make a response
    - want to make sure that requests handled by app servers are ONLY app server requests
    - loading of apps in threads, etc. may vary, but assume that apps are loaded into a memory footprint
    - 2. we can improve response time by pushing things up the tiers

  - node.js (application server / runtime), Deno, Puma (Ruby), Unicorn (Ruby)
    - list of application servers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_application_servers
    - notice the distinction between JS and node - JS is the language, node is the thing on which JS runs
      - node is an environment that javascript (code) runs in
      - similarly for Ruby (the language), it runs in Puma
      - that environment is an application server
    - note:  express is not an application server, it's a framework that makes it easier to launch an application server

- **database**:
  - if the application server goes offline and we don't have a database, we lose that data
    - a database gives persistence
    - when applications run, typically the things you work on are saved in RAM vs the HD or some other file system
    - memory (RAM) vs disk storage (persistent)
      - data in memory will disappear when you lose power
      - SSD solid state drives (SSDs) OR  Hard disk drives (a magnetic disk that spins)
        - SSDs are more expensive, HDs are cheaper
        - SSDs are typically faster
  - a database saves data to disk
    - keeps indexes
    - enforces a schema on data
    - organizes data to make it efficient to read and write
  - typically we refer to database software, sometimes we refer to the machine the database runs on

  - e.g., Postgres, Oracle, MySQL/MariaDB, SQLite

- real-life may not look exactly like the 3-tier described above
  - applications aren't re-built when requirements change
    - hence things won't be perfect
  - architectures will be based on the 3-tier

- upstream vs downstream
  - upstream: is closer to the user
  - downstream: further from the user
  - can think about it as a traversal of a request through the  system 



## Example
- e.g., basecamp
  - there is a user
  - there will be (broadly) the 3 tiers:
    - web server
    - application server
    - database
  
- user:  "give me basecamp.com./123/buckets/documents/789"
  - first goes through DNS to get IP address for basecamp.com
  - DNS responds
  - user machine then reaches out to IP address
  - webserver (could be nginx)
    - if it doesn't recognize the URL, will send to application server
      - webserver will be configured to send dynamic data to application server
  - app server sees that it's a basecamp rails app
    - app server parses the request, then gives it to the rails app (e.g., will parse the path, series of ids, etc.)
    - typically there's a routes file that maps route patterns to various parts of code
    - this instantiates the object code (a "controller") which may then go to the database
      - e.g., class DocControl, def get(id) #open db #fetch doc, etc.
      - a controller is a coordinator of business logic for a particular route, responsible for consolidating response from db to make a response
      - e.g., think MVC: model-view-control paradigm for structuring code
    - is the data from the database a fully-formed HTTP document?
      - typically no
      - data is consolidated by app server

- want to handle things as far upstream as possible
  - since it'll typically be faster
  - app server has to create an instance of the app in memory
  - want to have app server return a response without hitting the db, if possible - it will be faster
    - hence use of caches
  - db takes time:  open connection, retrieve data, close connection, etc.

- the app server may use 3rd party APIs
  - these should be consider the lowest in the stack 
  - i.e,. try to push requests to be handled higher up in your own stack since you have no control over 3rd party APIs

- 3rd party API:
  - another separate company that handles some specific function for you
  - e.g., Stripe for payments processing, etc.
  - a lot of network requests occur
  - these can add latency or create downtime - you have no control over these


- performance issues typically come up at database layers ("data layer")
  - this will impact all users to your site
  - the nature of those requests may be complex queries which take more time

- a single relational db can handle up to ~1000 queries / second (1000 qps)
  - this is a back of the napkin assumption to reason out system design questions

- scaling issues typically come up at the application server layer
  - app servers typically handle much less traffic than the db
  - make sure you check app servers before scaling dbs
  
- webservers are designed to be orders of magnitudes faster than app servers
    - they only handle simple speedy requests
    - you'll typically run into issues with app server and database
    - threshold at which to scale webservers is high enough that we won't really talk about it in capstone



- databases are not "owned" by their application
  - 1 application may access multiple dbs
  - 1 db may be accessed by multiple applications



- performance issues affect all users whether 1 or more
- scaling issues happen after a certain number of users


## horizontal vs vertical scaling
- vertical scaling
  - make your machine more powerful
  - pro:  less complexity, no change to structure
  - pro: cheaper in the beginning
    - another stick of RAM is cheaper
    - eventually, more RAM becomes obscenely expensive (it scales expoentially)
  - con: there are limits to how much you can vertically scale
    - no redundancy - creates a bigger SPOF

- horizontal scaling
  - add more machines
  - pro: inherently creates redundancy through replication of nodes(a backup by virtue of more machines)
    - much higher upper limit to how much you can scale
    - cheaper in the long run
    - flexibility to mix and match nodes
  - con: greater complexity
    - distributed system problems (e.g., unreliable networks)
    - will be harder to debug

- system design scaling is typically talking about horizontal scaling
  - much more interesting problem
  - need to think outside of what cloud provides like AWS, Digital Ocean might provide
    - want to be server-agnostic and think about what it might be like if we did this ourselves


## A Node:
  - could be virtual or physical
  - node will initially include
    - web server, app server, db
  - as that node starts to grow, the DB will be the first thing to split off onto it's own node
    - we're typically constrained by memory
    - HDs are typically far cheaper

  - if our app is 250 mB, for each 1GB of RAM, we can have 4 instances of that app
    - dbs use a LOT of memory for optimizations
    - caching, indexing, etc.
    - hence we typically want to separate the db from app server
  
  - web server fwds requests to app server, so best not to put too much distance between web and app server, if possible

  - generally, want to scale db independently from app server, hence we separate it to another node first

  - cons of separating db first:
    - adding distance (latency) between app server and db can be bad
    - assume that network is inherently unreliable
      - any distributed system (things on different nodes) will introduce problems (e.g., availability of nodes)
      - hard to know if nodes are busy or unavailable, etc.
        - these will be called "health checks" - regular pings to know if they're online or offline
        - we don't do health checks on 3rd party services

- tightly coupled vs loosely coupled
  - typically we talk about functionality within an application (i.e., parts of that application)
    - e.g., recommendations for other products is a part of the app:  a loosely coupled app might show something else so that the rest of the app can work if the recommendations section goes down

  - coupling also comes up with infrastructure - more relevant when we talk about microservices
    - i.e., when code functionality is split up into different infrastructure



## Use Cases
- always come first
- use cases are how a user can interact with our application
  - typically have end users, admins, testers, moderators, super users, etc.
  - when designing applications, we always focus on the end user perspective

- "Design YouTube" could be a prompt on a system design interview
  - user scenarios (we'd typically think about end users):
    - watch videos
    - upload videos
    - resume watching videos
    - subscribe/unsubscribe channels
    - add videos to lists
    - view watched history
    - commenting
    - searching

    - didn't add sign-up, login, etc.
      - these kinds of scenarios are NOT unique to youtube - they're common to most web apps
    - also didn't add functionality like advertising, banning/unbanning users, etc.
      - this could be asked, but it's best not to focus on niche use cases initially

  - from list of use cases, need to choose a few to start focusing on:
    - e.g., watch videos, add videos to playlist, subscribe to channels
    - need to pick focus areas for the benefit of the interview
    - should be able to create an interesting system design for selected use cases
    - need to define the boundaries of the system design problem


- e.g., "Design Reddit" use cases (think in terms of ACTIONS, not features)
  - make post
  - subscribe to subreddit
  - add comment
  - up/down vote
  - block users
  - upload images
  - search content
  - view inbox
  - send DM
  - saving posts

  - we are focusing on "WRITE-based" requests


  - there are also "READ-based" requests:
    - view a post
    - view a timeline
    - view saved posts
    - view upvoted/downvoted posts

  - need to focus on both read- and write-based requests

  - best to start by focusing on key use cases
    - could be:
      - making on posts
      - viewing posts
      - upvote/downvote
    - need to specify what reddit is so that we can model something

- in real life, there are other constraints
  - e.g., internal users, etc.
  - we just don't consider internal users or other competing concerns that don't get addressed in system design interviews

- in interviews, best to be focused with use cases
  - don't list 17 different things without communicating to an interviewer that you're just brainstorming use cases and will simplify later


### Services (functions)
  - need to think about what the arguments to the various functions might be
  - e.g., `createPost(userId, postContent, subredditId)` could be a function definition
  - `userId` and `subredditId` might be simple string / number / hash, etc.
  - `postContent` might be more complicated:
    - could be JSON
    - e.g., {
      postType: text,
      title: 'my title here',
      tag: 'spoiler',
      body: 'this will be variable depending on post',
      ...
    }
  - services / functions don't always come up in interviews, but thinking about it can help to think about API endpoints, etc. to support the use cases
  - might sometimes need to come up with an API endpoint (i.e., URL/path)
    - e.g., www.reddit.com/r/launchschool/submitPost
    POST
    Request params
    Request body

  - system design interviews are usually language agnostic
    - write pseudo-code or generic code
    - just try and communicate your thought-process
    - may need to write some basic SQL to fetch data from a db (e.g., select statements, insert statements, etc.)

- thinking about services will start to help you think about the DB
  - will identify need for:
  - user table with ID primary key (PK)
  - subreddit table w/ ID PK
  - post table w/ ID pk, postType varchar, content - JSON, etc.



## VPS project
- "server"
  - could be talking about hardware or software
  - hardware:  a powerful computer that responds to requests
  - software:  does actual computing to create responses
  - servers can also be both hardware and software

  - could run nginx on laptop, etc. 
    - so why use a VPS?
    - running a webserver on your laptop will constrain your resources
    - laptop may not be optimized to be a webserver, etc.
    - it would need to be up all of the time


- if you run nginx on your laptop
  - can anyone outside your home laptop see your app?
  - not by default
  - your laptop requires a public IP for others to be able to access your app
    - typically your router has a public IP (which is assigned by your ISP)
    - WAN setting on router will be the public IP
    - most residential ISP have dynamic IP addresses - so IPs may change, which make DNS difficult
      - port forwarding / tunnelling etc. may also affect 

    - the laptop has only a private IP - typically 192.168.42.170 (or something like that) - it's assigned by the router

  - many ISPs also have provisions which limit you from creating "commercial" websites that are available publically

- you could deploy on heroku, but it's better to get the experience deploying to your own system
  - use a VPS to make it public and provide practice
  - also so we can start from a clean slate
  - VPS has a public IP

- deploy:
  - copy files from 1 place to another so that everyone can access them
  - i.e., copy from where you develop to your production environment (e.g., the VPS)


- laptop is dev environment
- VPS is the production environment

Team Project
- we'll use the team project on our resumes, as well
  - treat it as a learning experience

# Basecamp intro to system design
Introduction

    if the application and code-level concerns are Earth, we're going to be zooming out and learning about the solar system. The solar system is the distributed system that supports the application.
    we'll learn through lots of conversation and discussion. Please ask questions!
    please default to having your video on, this helps facilitate conversation.
    we'll have lots of homework, but think about it like a buffet. 
        There are some things we definitely want you to eat, but you don't need to "finish" the buffet.
        This is not mastery-based learning. You're going for the gist of the material, learning enough to let you move forward.
        We'll have homework for each learning type. Lots of reading, videos, and doing (your VPS project)
    lean into learning. Try to approach learning from a position of curiosity and excitement, not fear or anxiety. There are no assessments.


2 Main Goals during System Design Weeks

    learn a framework to use in approaching system design interviews
    fill in your mental map of distributed system concepts to serve as a foundation for Capstone project research
        building your conceptual knowledge and vocabulary will help in interviews as well

Note: No project will give you "production" experience, but this will serve as a strong signal about your skill level and ability to learn.


How is this Different than Weeks 1 and 2?

    designed to prepare you for a different type of interview
    more conversational, less code
    no single "right" answer (although there are definitely wrong answers)
    learn to talk in terms of tradeoffs
    demonstrate understanding of the answer not selected, the path not taken



Schedule for Weeks 3 and 4

    Week 3 - narrative of building distributed systems
        functional system design
            introduction to 3-tier architecture
            database design and ERD's 
        computer resources (memory, cpu, storage)
        splitting components of a single node system out into separate nodes
            a node can be a server, VM, or a container
        key components of a distributed system
            horizontal scaling and n-tier architecture
            caches, load balancers, databases, app servers
        background jobs
        setting up your VPS
    Week 4 - deep dive into specific distributed system topics
        building an application on your VPS as a team
        database scaling and partitioning (sharding)
        NoSQL vs. SQL databases
        consistent hashing
        monoliths vs. microservices
        event-driven architecture
        guest speakers coming to talk about actual distributed systems they're working on



# Homework

Important!
For today, do the reading/watching homework first, then meet with your group. This will not necessarily be the case every day. 

Homework, Readings, Videos:
Readings and videos will cover some foundational concepts that will help us be able to create ERD's (Entity Relationship Diagrams), and will give us some background on scaling our 3-tier architecture to the next level.

    Review the below topics in the Launch School SQL book. You don't need to memorize the SQL or do the exercises, but refresh yourself on the concepts:
        understanding 1:M and M:M associations:
          - https://launchschool.com/books/sql/read/table_relationships#onetomany
          - https://launchschool.com/books/sql/read/basics_tutorial#datavsschema

        schema vs data view
    Google "data normalization" and "normal forms"
        high level understanding only - timebox to 15 minutes
    [Watch The Secret Life of SQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuDWWadCqIw) - talk on improving database performance with EXPLAIN
    Read through this [Guide to the Entity Relationship Diagram](https://www.databasestar.com/entity-relationship-diagram/) for a quick rundown on ERD's. We'll be drawing a lot of these this week as a way to model and visualize data in a database.
        we use Crow's Foot notation in our ERD's, so focus on that section and ignore the other notation types
    [Scaling to 100K Users blog post](https://alexpareto.com/scalability/systems/2020/02/03/scaling-100k.html)
        covers horizontally scaling a single node system into a "small" distributed system
    [The 5 Most Common Performance Bottlenecks](https://www.itbriefcase.net/the-5-most-common-application-bottlenecks)
        details computer resource constraints; provides motivation for scaling system (vertically or horizontally)
        while this article describes RAM and storage options like HDD (hard disk drives) and SSD (solid state drive) in two separate categories, recently the line between them is blurring as data access speeds for SSD options like NVMe start to approach the universe of RAM speeds. [Optional] See this [blog post](https://world.hey.com/dhh/hardware-is-fun-again-b819d0b4) if you're interested in learning more.


Group Work:

    Create 1 page summary documents with your team to share in class tomorrow. Time box both to 60 minutes.
        Write up a one page summary on indexes
            What are they?
            Why are they useful?
            What are their advantages and disadvantages?
        Write up a one page summary on normalization
            What is it?
            What is over-normalization?
            Pros/cons
            What's an example where normalization makes sense? What about an example where it doesn't make sense?



VPS Server

    If you haven't started this yet, start getting some hands on experience with setting up a VPS and deploying an app on it. 
    If you've done that already, try to add a db-powered app (can be same app, or a new app)
    goal: by Thursday, you will have gone all the way to db-powered app deployed on VPS. If anyone on a team has gotten it working, please help teammates, if necessary. 
    Although we want each student to get their own VPS up and running, don't hesitate to work with your group! If you're having trouble, debug and brainstorm with teammates. If you got it running end to end, take time to explain to teammates.

    Read this very short but exciting cautionary [story](https://medium.com/@jakswa/the-night-the-postgresql-ids-ran-out-9430a2dbb895) about blowing up a database by running out of primary keys. 
    We talked a little bit about applications being loaded into a process when a request hits a server. Check out [this link](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1518615221887152128) for a quick breakdown of programs (applications), processes, and threads. Here's a [different resource](https://mailchi.mp/railsspeed/how-many-ruby-processes-per-cpu-is-ideal?e=6bf57ed66c) that discusses tradeoffs when considering how many processes to run per CPU. You don't need to know these things, feel free to read if you're curious.
