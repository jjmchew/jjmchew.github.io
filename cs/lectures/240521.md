# May 21, 2024 Systems Design Day 2

## HW review

### Data normalization (Team 4)
- What is it?
  - process of re-organizing data to make it easier to work with and query
  - removing unstructured or redundant data
  - data normalization follows rules called "normal forms"
    - how many normal forms?
      - there are typically 3 normal forms, everything beyond 3 is more academic in practice
      - it is unlikely that anyone will ask you about what the rules are in each normal form


- over-normalization:
  - applying too much normalization which creates inefficiences and makes the database cumbersome
    - e.g., too many joins when querying which increases query time
    - normalizing on the wrong field can create more trouble
      - e.g., can't normalize on a field which contains a full address since it is unlikely to have duplication of data here (a 1:1 relationship doesn't require normalization)
      - data normalization makes sense in a 1:many relationship


- pros:
  - data integrity and consistency
    - e.g., eliminating typos (e.g., different ways to spell, indicate the state of California)

  - ease of updates
    - change to one table shouldn't affect other tables
    - there's 1 place to update the data that represents 1 thing (e.g., a state name like California)

  - reduce redundancy
  - efficient storage
    - data is stored in only 1 place


- cons:
  - complexity of data schema
  - slower query execution (use of joins - involves multiple tables to execute a query)
  - slower write operations
  - data analysis is more complex


- may want to denormalize: to speed up queries (prevent use of joins in queries)


- when initially creating a db:'
  - better to overnormalize initially?
  - normalize: take something that exists in 1 table and break it out into 2 or more
    - decision to de-normalize will depend on data usage (e.g., queries)
    - if there are data integrity issues, may need to normalize data
  - when designing the data schema for the first time, there's no "before state"

- normalizing or denormalizing both essentially require the same effort

- note the difference between front-end input validation (eliminating typos by selecting CA from a dropdown)
  - remember that the database may be accessed in different ways - API requests, etc. not just through the front-end UI
  - managing database constraints is the fundamental data-management technique

- names: any need to normalize into first and last name?
  - if you always want first and last, it's best not to normalize since you wouldn't want to retrieve the full name over 2 tables
    - also, there are legitimate different spellings of the same name, so there may not be much value in normalizing


#### Class example - data normalization
- given a table containing students with student attributes:
  - studentID
  - firstName_student
  - lastName_student
  - gpa
  - firstName_advisor
  - lastName_advisor
  - advisorTitle
  - advisorDepartment

- could break this up into 2 different tables:
  - student
    - id
    - firstName
    - lastName
    - gpa
    - advisor_id

  - advisor
    - id
    - firstName
    - lastName
    - title
    - department

- steps:
  - 1. create new schema (incl. constraints)
  - 2. data migration to new tables
  - 3. update application code (account for the new table)


- why denormalize?
  - any bias for faster reads
    - e.g., for archiving
  - 1:many vs 1:1:
    - if data in both tables ends up being 1:1, then it makes sense to de-normalize
    - think about what top-level entities are:
      - e.g., address isn't typically a top-level entity (e.g., for launchschool)
        - but for a real estate listing, or for a post office, an address might be a top-level entity for those applications


- **top-level entity**: any "important" thing for the schema, which is usually it's own table in a data schema


### Indexes (Team 3)
- can think of these as indexes in a book
  - almost exactly the same


- indexes are a separate table created with all the rows, but only selected columns
  - typically these indexes are sorted in a specific way to make a query easier
  - indexes could be implemented as a b-tree or hashes


- why are they useful?
  - leverage the sorted structure to make searching much more efficient
  - it's faster and easier to search a smaller table and then lookup full data from another table if required


- pros:
  - speed up searching / queries by using binary search
    - simplifying something of linear complexity O(N) to log complexity O(logN)


- cons:
  - take up space
  - slow down write/update/insert/delete
  - additional overhead to use and maintain
    - modify queries to leverage indexes
    - manage redundant indexes


- for read-heavy applications, use an index
  - most applications are read-heavy and thus indexes make sense
  - e.g., twitter - much more read vs write (more people will read a post)

  - indexes could speed updates, but not inserts
    - i.e,. searching for an entry first and then updating; the searching would be faster


- indexes are usually in-memory (RAM) to make them faster
  - we usually have more space on disk storage and db's typically write to disk for persistent storage
  - but typically RAM is much faster (although that's changing a bit now)
  - indexes are also written to disk for persistence, but the indexes are loaded into memory


## In-class exercise:  create an ERD

### Assignment
Deliverable - create an ERD for the database tables of a todo application.

    Fulfill the following use cases:
        a user can create multiple todo lists
        multiple users can collaborate on a todo list
        a user can create todos
        a todo can be marked completed
    Make sure to create the tables and relationships between each table. 
        Some examples of possible tables might be "Users" and "TodoLists"
    Diagram both 1:M and M:M relationships
        Examples of possible relationships might be each user can have many todo lists. How would you designate this with crows foot notation?
    Add the properties for each table. What columns should they have? 
    Don't worry about datatypes for each column
    Use an application like excalidraw or draw.io or similar


### Discussion
- adding the join table explicitly:
  - it makes more sense to show the join table if there are additional attributes to add to that table
    - e.g., who is the owner, when was the relationship added, etc.

- when including a join table in the ERD diagram - will need to follow-up to see if the cardinality is based on the primary entities rather than the join table
  - it probably only makes sense to include the join table if there are additional attributes that are required
  - it's also better to state assumptions in an interview
    - e.g., I will break out this many to many relationship into an explicit table

- for ERDs: typically just looking at "nouns"
  - for OOP, may think about "verbs" and "nouns"
  - note that the creation of the todo is distinct from the data that we might store about that todo
    - hence, a link between user and the todo may not strictly be necessary if it's not directly stated in the use cases

- creating use cases are helpful to frame the solution - check with the interviewer
  - they make add a use case later, etc. and the diagram may need to be updated to accommodate

- think about "search" functionality as "filtering"
  - i.e., among the list of all possible data, we'd look for data associated with some specific attribute (e.g., users, etc.)


## Self-referential relationships
- e.g., think of a table "employee"
  - attributes:
    - id
    - name
    - department
    - salary
    - title
    - assets
    - date_of_hire
    - manager_id

- manager_id:
  - a little bit unique since the manager is ALSO an employee
  - this is a 1:1 self-referential relationship
  - you COULD break this out into a different table if:
    - there are other attributes that are specific to managers
    - could also just add (optional) columns within the existing employee table that are for managers
  - manager_id may also be optional (e.g., the CEO may not have a "manager")
  - a manager has 1 or more managers
  - an employee has 1 or no managers


- e.g. book recommendations
  - may have a "books" table:
    - id, title, author, publisher, genre
  - would be best to add a "recommendations" table
    - id PK, recommender_id FK, recommendee_id FK
    - this creates a many to many relationship between books

  - shouldn't be using an array type within relational dbs
    - if you have a "compound" value, you should probably create a table and use joins to manage that 1 to many relationship


## Shopping cart exercise
- build a shopping cart
- top entities:
  - cart (essentially 1:1 with user, so don't need user as a top entity)
  - products

- can build a "product" table
  - id PK
  - SKU
  - name
  - price
  - inventory

- can build a "cart" table
  - id PK
  - intuitively we may want to add, but actually shouldn't:
    - product_id FK
    - quantity

- need to think about implicit entities
  - need a join table to store items that you've added to your cart
  - need to figure out what each record in the table represents
  - hence, can't just add product_id FK, quantity to the "cart" table

- hence:  create a "cart_item" table
  - id PK
  - cart_id FK
  - product_id FK
  - quantity (amount added to cart)
  - price (this is repeated since price of the product may change later, but you'd want to track the price at which the product will be purchased)
  - order_id
  - order_date

- price : within the "cart_item" table:
  - this needs to be included, and provides flexibility to accommodate different business logic
  - e.g., should the price change in the cart if the "real-time" prices changes before you checkout?
    - business logic (requirements) will need to be determined and addressed within the app


- NOTE:  it's best practice that primary keys are DISTINCT from any other piece of info within the database
  - it's best for security that the PK is used only for the db
  - it's best not to expose your database to the rest of the world


- "soft-delete" : means there might be some additional attributes like "deleted?" or "date_deleted" to track whether or not that item was later removed


- Discounts:
  - could have per-product discounts
    - there may be a code for a specific product
    - there may be BROAD discounts
  - could also have per-cart discounts
  - could create another "discount" table
    - include id PK, discount_type, discount_amount, start_date, end_date
  - might then apply the discount to the cart_item OR product OR cart (as appropriate for discount type)
    - where you reference the discount will have a different effect on the scope


## Interviews
- typically the problem will be something like "design reddit", "design twitter", "design a shopping cart", etc., 
  - could also be "design a notification service", "design a messaging service"
- need to be able to reason through things
- what might the architecture of a chat room system look like?
- what might the system architecture be to allow users to chat in real-time
  - how could you scale the system?
  - what if you had multiple chat rooms?
  - could you be in multiple chat rooms at once?

- typically, there's no objectively correct answer, but they want to see that you're thoughtful about what you consider
  - do you make decisions backed by reason
  - be confident and positive - think soft skills
  - be someone that others want to work with

- interviews are typically driven by the interviewer - could focus on specific parts, could push the conversation in different ways
  - follow their lead - don't try and push back
  - interviewers may push you beyond the initial prompt (e.g., change constraints, etc.)
    - they're looking for boundaries of your capability
  - saying "I don't know" isn't necessarily a bad thing - be clear about what you know and what you don't know
  - you could always say, "I'd guess", or "my approach would be..."

  - requirements will always change when you're working as a software engineer


- within "system design" there is a subset of "functional system design"
  - typically focused on current state (i.e., today)
  - for functional system design, it's typically to the ERD level and possibility talk about schema
  - the ERD represents the current state
  - some interviews may ask for sql statements



- after ERD, will typically ask about scaling questions
  - then this becomes more of a infrastructure question


- if you're not familiar with the app they're asking you to create, you should indicate that
  - you could also ask for a different scenario

- "I'm going to make assumptions..."
- ask if interviewers are okay with any decisions you make
  - they typically have an end goal in mind, so check in with them to see if you're heading in the right direction

- consider the amount of time available
  - if you've only got 30 mins, better to have fewer use caess
  - if you've got 90 mins, it might be better to have more use cases

- interview could be on the phone:
  - you'd have to jot things down for yourself
  - typically there will be a whiteboard (miro, excalidraw, etc.) so you can diagram
    - they'll typically provide a login

- when making ERDs, build them up gradually
  - think about it use case by use case

- if asked to create SQL statements
  - you could indicate that a requested query might be very cumbersome or difficult
    - worth having a discussion about that
  
- for data attributes:
  - think about how exact that metric needs to be
  - is it a "cached" value?
    - something that exists upstream to shorten the retrieval time
  - calculated vs real value?
    - a cache value may also refer to a value that isn't the source of truth (it's derived from something else) 
    - may also refer to redundant data used to speed performance
    - the calculated value would be "derived" and NOT the source of truth
    - the "real" value would be the "source of truth"

- roles in dev (from the bottom - most junior):
  - this refers to the "IC" route:  individual contributor
  - the problems that are worked on become larger as you get more senior, problems get more ambiguous


  - junior / associate engineer : typically get well-scoped tasks
  - software engineer (SWE II roles) : might get a problem and have to figure out
  - senior engineers : here's a difficulty, figure out the problem and the solution
  - staff engineers : typically takes 5 minimum to reach staff
  - principal engineers


  - mgmt roles:
    - Team lead
    - Engineering Mgr
    - Director of Eng
    - CTO


## Interview Notes from BaseCamp
System Design Interviews

Most system design interviews are based on "Design X" type questions, where X could be any well-known application, like Youtube or Facebook. 

Most interviews are conversational, where you are discussing (and often diagramming) the application from multiple perspectives (infrastructure, metrics, data, etc.).

Often very driven by interviewers and their personalities/agendas:

    they will hone in on particular parts of your answer that they want you to expand upon
    they'll direct the conversations in different areas that they want you to go
    they will push you to find the limits of your knowledge

What are interviewers looking for?

    conceptual knowledge
    understanding of tradeoffs
        why didn't you design it in a certain way?
    there is no perfect system, just better systems for certain use cases
        use cases determined by data requirements
    the right vocabulary

Functional System Design
A Method for Approaching System Design Interviews

Goal

    describe the current system, not how it would scale
    deliverable: an ERD or schema that can support all use cases
        ERD - includes entities, attributes, and relationships between entities
        schema - translate entities and attributes into formal tables and columns, including primary keys, foreign keys, column data types, constraints

Approach

    similar to PEDAC, but at system level
    not all steps below are required; use as you please, but keep in mind the end goal is an ERD or schema (depends on the interview)! 


Step 1: Use Cases

    Think: workflows for specific roles (usually end user)
        ex: a user can create a post
    focus on primary workflows or processes to the system in question
        not narrow or edge cases, usually; not common workflows (ex: logging in)
    draw upon previous experience for fleshing out use cases
        ex: price should be on order as well as product, since they could be different
        disadvantage if you're asked to design a system for which you have zero context
            good interviewers will try to not do this, or offer a lot of help
            ask clarifying questions, or if it gets too awkward, can just ask for a different system
    With the interviewer, clarify requirements and validate your assumptions of key use cases of the system and their functional requirements. In other words, get buy-in from the interviewer.
        "I'm going to make assumptions here..."
    Scope the use cases you want to design for this interview with the interviewer
    Consider the time you have when thinking about how many use cases to handle. A good reason to start small and simple, and add on to it if there's time available
    Deliverable: sentences or paragraphs that describes the main use cases.


Step 2: Services - Optional (not seen in interviews often but may be asked)

    After fleshing out use cases, translate to "services".
    Think: function / method signatures that with arguments. The arguments are going to inform how we design the schema
    Ex: "create_post"
        Inputs/outputs to service
            Input: title, description, etc
            Output/result: data retrieved from database / data written to database
        read/writes to database
    Can also be represented via API
    Deliverable: method signatures with arguments


Step 3: Database Schema Design

    Extract entities from the use cases. They are usually the nouns from your use case. 
    ERD is usually the end goal, but we can push to a schema (columns, data types, constraints, etc.)
    Think about what each record in a table represents.
        Ex: with the cart table in the shopping cart app, a single record represents one user's shopping cart.
    Trace the actions of a user for a particular use case through the ERD. When and where are records created? 
        Ex: when a user clicks on a product to add it to their shopping cart, data about the product, quantity they're adding, and which user is adding it is sent to the application. A record in the cart_items table is created with the cart_id of the cart associated with that user and the product_id of the product they added.
        Thinking through each use case will help you figure out which attributes are necessary for your entities, and will validate whether your ERD can support a use case.
    Start simple and take it use case by use case. Just diagram enough of an ERD to facilitate a single core use case before moving on
    Think about what functionality this design makes very easy or difficult.
    Deliverable:  ERD or schema


Step 4: Functional Design

    How to implement the services? 
    For applications with simple logic, this could just be SQL commands to read and write data.
    Deliverable: SQL statements 



## Homework

Homework, Readings, Videos:

Order of operations doesn't matter too much today, feel free to tackle group work on a schedule that works best for your team.

Group Work

    Create a Twitter ERD that covers basic functionality in order to practice with different relationships between tables 
        Time box to 60 minutes
        We want to stay at a high level with basic features specific to Twitter. Pick a couple of common use cases that are specific to Twitter. Don't worry about functionality common to most/all web application (login, etc.)
        We’re looking for 3-5 entities, not 10. 
        Main table relationships: 
            1-to-1 tables, 1-to-M tables, M-to-M tables
            Two types of self-referential tables: 1-to-M and M-to-M.
        Remember that with the self-referential tables, you drop the number of tables by one. 
            You usually have 2 tables with a 1-to-M relationship. With a self-referential 1-to-M, you have 1 table. 
            You normally have 3 tables with a M-to-M relationship (two separate tables with a join table in between). With a M-to-M self-referential, you have 2 tables. 
        Hints
            Feel free to include a user table, it'll be closely linked with other entities
            Watch out for implicit nouns
            Watch out calculated vs real attributes. What does that mean? 
                Example - if capturing voting on Reddit was a use case, we'd have a votes table, but we could also cache vote totals in a column like 'vote_count' in the post and/or comments table. Does that attribute need to be calculated on the fly? Or should we cache it so we can reference easily? 


Homework

    We're going to be creating an ERD for Launch School quizzes in teams during the first hour of lecture tomorrow. Spend 30 minutes tonight:
        Reviewing your old quizzes in the actual Launch School app to confirm how quizzes are implemented. How did you interact with quizzes as a student? How might a staff member interact with quizzes?
