## Sharding & consistent hashing
- see basecamp doc
- review of yesterday's discussion

## NoSQL databases

### mongoDb
  - see notes from Team 1
  - document store in BSON (similar to jsonB from postgres)
  - collections and documents instead of tables and rows

- don't need to memorize details of mongoDb
  - the specific details aren't stricly necessary to memorize
  - know that some of the concepts are analogous to relational dbs
    - e.g., election of primaries (if a primary goes down)
    - e.g., once sharded, you can't unshard (it's relatively irreversible), but you can re-shard
  - great for nested data structures
    - i.e., lots of "leaves on a branch" (e.g., like launch school quizzes)

- generally, a relational DB should be our default
  - think of other db types for specific use cases

- comments on reversing sharding:
  - think of any db action as a database migration
  - db sizes only get bigger - so you would never fit things onto 1 db again
  - there will be db migration issues to go back to a single data store
  - once you create multiple databases, you've multiplied the number of instances you need to worry about for database migration

- discussion about going from relational to non-relational dbs
  - typically wouldn't REPLACE the relational, you'd just ADD the non-relational


### Redis
- key value store
- prioritizes availabiliy over consistency
- anything you might store in short-term memory
  - caching, session mgmt, message broker (pub/sub), anything real-time because of its speed (being in memory)

- it's built for speed
- may not be as configurable for db access permissions as relational dbs

- key value stores are very common
- significant drawbacks:
  - more specialized than mongoDb
  - limited space : can be expensive relative to the amount of space available (RAM), cost isn't the key, it's most the limitation on space
  - having a key, getting a value is the primary use case:  makes querying difficult
    - must relate data within app code



- document dbs are not considered key-value stores in these ways:
  - the way the data is stored:
    - mongo stores data in a way that improves the ability to query

    - key-value store is more like a hash map - less query flexibility

  - document stores aren't inherently meant to be in memory
    - hence speed for key-value store is higher (Redis is built from the ground up to be in-memory, although it offers disk persistence as an option)



- ways to assess marketing vs reality:
  - look at history of product (look at versions) to understand what core functionality was (e.g., Redis vs Mongo - where they started reflects their core competency: in-memory for document store)
  - look at general product "family" and how other products in the same family operate / have limitations
  - generally there isn't any need to go dig around in the source code



### timescale:
  - should check https://www.timescale.com/


  - use cases:  all concerned about data with a time element
    - monitoring metrics and analytics
    - dashboard data
  - because successive values over time are captured (like an append only log)
    - this is prioritized over updating values
    - it's hard to update timeseries databases, generally just for writing - adding data
    - time can't be a null value
  - timeseries dbs are best for trends - looking at a single value isn't as useful as looking at the trend over a number of values over time
  - timescale dbs were designed to query time-based data in much more natural way
    - i.e., look at historical analysis 
    - timescale is built on postgres
      - use compression algorithms for time-ordered data
      - can compress historical values to "downsample" data into less values
      - recent values can have higher number of values



### columnar dbs (e.g., cassandra):
  - no joins in a columnar db
  - very specific format in which to write / structure info
  - no joins in a columnar db
  - biggest takeaway is that data is stored by column instead of storing it by row
    - this makes it performant to run queries against large amounts of data
    - e.g., you don't get a true "table" which has rows for student and columns for marks in different classes
    - you would only store students and grade in math
    - this makes queries very performant in retrieving math grades, but that table will only be able to do query that math grade
  - uses consistent hashing
  - no updating data - append-only
  - good for large datasets
  - column data is stored together "under-the-hood"
    - so you can't "slice and dice" within a column - it's designed to just pull the column



### graph dbs (e.g., neo4j)
- the relationships between data is more important than the data itself
  - think graph: 
    - node : some data
    - edges : represent relationships
- the goal with graph dbs is typically finding paths (e.g., shortest, common, etc.)
- use cases:
  - often used for recommendation systems
  - used for fraud detection
  - finding social network relationships

- strengths:
  - can represent and query complex relationships
  - no need to join relational db tables - hence much faster

- weaknesses:
  - harder to find support, limited tooling
  - steep learning curve
  - not optimized for simple queries (as compared to relational dbs)
  - can be complex to manage, takes up more space (representing relationships)

- typically emphasize consistency over availability

- note:  graphQL has NOTHING to do with graph databases
  - graphQL is an alternative to REST APIs
  - graph theory ties these things together, but is distinct


### newSQL 
- NewSQL specialize in OLTP (online transaction processing)
  - small changes, but fast

- OLAP (online analytical processing) : complex queries over large volumes of aggregated data

- use consensus algorithms
- can also be used for in-memory processing
- relatively immature
- higher complexity in deployment/management
- still emphasize strong complexity

- cockroachDB, VoltDB


### Vector DBs
- vector dbs use ML to determine numerical embeddings which can be used to group like things together
- vector dbs use vector embeddings to group, store, query like things



## Monolith vs Microservices

### monoliths:
  - all logic lives in a single application
  - pieces communicate use in-memory function calls

- benefits:
  - immediate consistency - the amount of time it takes for the application to be consistent is much faster (since everything is in-memory)
  - easier to reason about as a system
  - same programming languages / tech choices
    - everyone can work on all parts of the app
  - vertical / horizontal scaling involves just 1 type of server
    - can scale it up or out

- drawbacks:
  - everything uses the same tech stack (regardless if that's the best choice)
  - can be hard to reason about as a single entity
  - tight coupling - the entire codebase lives together, and it can be hard to separate the parts of it
    - a bug in 1 section can break another part of the codebase
    - changes to 1 module may have unintended impacts to other modules
  - when scaling, you'll have to scale the entire application
    - hard to scale just 1 part of the app
  - when deploying - you'll deploy the entire code base
    - automated testing
    - run tests:
      - unit tests: testing individual functions
      - integration tests: how different modules work together
      - end-to-end: testing use of the application through the whole system (based upon end-user scenarios)
      - regression testing: no existing functionality is broken by new code
      - performance testing: are we still performant?  stable? have new changes to the app negatively responsiveness and stability of the app
        - e.g., load testing - try to break the app through increased loads / traffic
      - UAT (user acceptance testing): to make sure the app still meets user requirements
        - a sub-category of end-to-end testing
        - may be done by actual users
    - need to version code
      - may use semantic versioning:
        - e.g., x.y.z
        - x is breaking change
        - y is major change
        - z is minor change
    - need to lint code (check for syntax errors, or style issues)
      - makes the codebase consistent - easier to read

    - need to compile code
    - need to package compiled code
    - need to create new images
    - need to scan for security vulnerabilities

  - the larger the application, the longer all of the potential steps associated with deployment take
    - LS app takes several hours to change and deploy
    - can be cumbersome

  - organizational considerations
    - thousands of engineers working on the same codebase makes changes difficult
      - merge conflicts make things difficult
    - larger organizations may use different versioning systems to checkout (and lock) files from further edits

- when transitioning to microservices, there are patterns you may apply
  - e.g., strangler fig pattern
    - if a monolith has ABCDE functionality, start shifting functionality in layers:
    - i.e., first step is ABCDE E
    - then transition to ABCD E
    - then pick another service:  ABCD D E
      - then ABC D E
    - etc.

- e.g., hotel app
  - may be different components:
    - reservationsa
    - admin
    - maintenance
    - housekeeping
  - could all live in a single monolithic app and share a common db
    - db might contain "rooms", "beds", "minutesToClean", "repairHistory", etc.
  - each component will access other components by making calls across components

  - in microservices:
    - break each module into a separate service
    - create a separate data store for each service
    - services are all connected via an event bus (a pub/sub service) that can communicate changes that are made to all services
      - e.g., adding a room to the hotel via a hotel addition needs to be added to every other service and corresponding db

    

### microservices:
  - communicate via communication over a network

  - use of a pub/sub service to communicate with other services is itself a service
    - all errors need to be handled

  - microservices have eventual consistency
    - need to wait for updates to be made to all systems

  - it's much less likely for individual services to stop operation of other services

  - this is similar to the sharding discussion:
    - it's best to start with a monolith

  - each service will be independent of each other
    - may also be organizational distinct
    - all services that are in-house would communicate via pub/sub

  - out-sourcing to a 3rd party isn't really a consideration on whether something is considered microservices or not
      - many monoliths might have "satellite" (outsourced) services where it makes sense
      - you would communicate with those services via API calls



## monoliths vs microservices
- there's no absolute definition to what is a monolith or a microservice
  - it's more of a gradient

- most applications should be monoliths
  - small teams / small codebase - should be monoliths


### anti-patterns:
- breaking things into services, but keeping 1 version of the data (i.e,. 1 db)
  - each service should have it's own DB as a rule
  - if all services require room info, each db should have a copy of that room info and changes should be propagated to each service
  - otherwise, changes to the db could introduce breaking changes to other services



- using direct synchronous network calls between services
  - i.e., NOT using a message bus
  - this will add more latency
  - is essentially building a distributed monolith
    - instead of making fast in-memory calls, all related services will slow down, as well
  - slowness of 1 system will spread to others
  - i.e., you won't want systems to be tightly coupled

  - conway's law:  your application resembles your organization
    - independent teams working on their own services leads to less tightly coupled services


### best practices
- don't use microservices unless you have to
  - need a very good reason
  - will introduce complexity into system
    - debugging will be harder
    - scattered services and their communication chains gets more complicated

- always start new projects / apps as monoliths
  - "greenfield" : new projects
  - "brownfield" : existing projects

- generally easier to transition brownfield services to microservices
  - documentation makes it easier
  - people with knowledge of the system makes it easier
  - having a baseline (monolith) to compare against makes microservice implementation easier
  - keep microservices small
    - create the smallest possible service that doesn't require chatty communication between services
    - want to minimize interservice communication

- invest in a good observability framework
  - "observability" : gives information about the system
    - info is typically:
      - metrics:  e.g., how many 500 errors / unit time
      - logging:  actual logs to computer (e.g., console.log)
      - tracing: tracing the network path between services
        - e.g., in dev tools, message went to these services and took x amount of time there
  - observability is a big thing in the tech world now, especially with complex, distributed systems

- avoid breaking changes in the interface between services
  - make the interface and the consumption of interfaces tolerant


### trends
in tech:
- monoliths vs microservices
  - has been swinging back and forth
  - microservices was very trendy for a while, but things are swinging back towards monoliths
    - basecamp:  "the majestic monolith":  https://medium.com/signal-v-noise/the-majestic-monolith-29166d022228

    - shopify:  also a monolith
    - amazon moved from microservice to monolith to get better scalability: 
      - https://www.primevideotech.com/video-streaming/scaling-up-the-prime-video-audio-video-monitoring-service-and-reducing-costs-by-90
    
  - most apps aren't fully monolith or microservice
    - typically there is a monolith core with satellite microservices
      - microservices will depend on specific use cases - traffic, etc.
      - microservices buy you options

Readings, Videos, Homework:

    Read - sections 1-4 of the [Apex writeup](https://apex-api-proxy.github.io/) (stop before section 5 - Design and Architecture). 
        Sections 1-3 will give you a good breakdown of microservices, while section 4 will introduce service meshes and API proxies (used in Homework section below)
        Video - If you'd prefer a video version instead, check out the [Apex presentation](http://dkq85ftleqhzg.cloudfront.net/capstone_presentations/Apex.mp4) up until the Design and Architecture  section
    Service Meshes, API Gateways, and Message Queues represent 3 different microservice communication patterns. Feel free to either read or watch videos on these. If you feel comfortable with the concepts after doing either the reading or watching the videos, don't feel like you need to do the other for completeness.
