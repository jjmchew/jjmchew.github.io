## Types of system design interviews
- the language used below is LS language
- you need to check-in with the interviewer to establish what they want to see
  - e.g., compare OO design vs database design
  - functional system design is not an industry term
    - interviewers may not distinguish between terms ERD and schema
  - e.g., conceptual design is not an industry term


- OO Design (Object Oriented Design)
  - e.g., "design a parking lot"
  - extract nouns (classes) and verbs (methods)
  - deals with application code
  - organize verbs into nouns (methods accessible to classes)

  - make sure you understand the question and what they want you to design
    - establish use cases up front
    - develop a class diagram
    - need to decide if things are classes or properties of classes
      - we'll get this info as a recorded lecture at the beginning of the job hunt
      - this kind of question seemed a bit less current, hence just a recorded lecture


- functional systems design
  - make sure you establish use cases first
    - e.g., addresses in zillow is different than address in launch school - think about top-level entities
  - classes in app-code can exist independently of each other
  - entities in ERDs will have relationships

  - note entity vs table:
    - entity is higher-level (a conceptual model)
    - table is a specific implementation
      - e.g,. entity may be "student" and "teacher", but table may just be "user" with a column identifying student or teacher




- performance issues - may just be like trivia questions in an interview
  - may be shorter questions - e.g., "we've designed the system, but we're seeing slowdowns, where would you look to determine issues?"



- to discuss scaling:
  - likely want to add some ideas of metrics
  - can then talk about potential strategies (e.g., caching, replication, etc.) and have conversations about tradeoffs
  - should think about the intended goals (e.g., 10x traffic or 1000x traffic)
  - then, can start "spitballing" : typically conversational
    - just probing knowledge and get an idea of your thought process


- system design interview book:
  - some companies want that level of complexity (e.g., google)
  - generally, other companies don't need that level of precision
  - googles, etc. tend to have very LONG job hunt process (e.g., could take 4 months, etc.)
    - in the past, people have gotten other offers before the longer processes close


- conceptual diagrams
  - primarily about showing components - doesn't relate to scaling, etc.
  - we'll get lots of experience with this in capstone project
  - approach things methodically


- design an API:
  - check resources provided
  - it's not super common, but could be worth it




## Final system design cheatsheet
- famous AWS email from Jeff Bezos - must design all services to be externalizable and have no dependencies
  - Netflix is on AWS
  - Amazon's focus on supporting startups helped them grow

- start to collect interesting topics for capstone research
  - it may help to watch the system design overview videos, and browse other system design resources
  - front-end is always changing - it evolves very quickly



## Capstone projects
- need to fit into the "goldilocks" zone:
  - not too complex or obscure (other software engineers should generally agree that it's a problem)
  - not too easy : shouldn't be trivial

- when doing research for capstone - should do a lot of prototyping to inform and validate the research
  - identify the problems associated with building the application
  - what kinds of problems crop up

- not everyone has to be a 10/10 excitement level to move forward with a project
  - remember that the capstone project is primarily about getting a job
  - be open to what potential projects could look like

- Max and Nick have been wondering about how to add some AI spice to projects
  - e.g., Captain Webhook - add Pirate AI to project



## RequestBin demos
- captain webhook: pretty awesome
  - integrated pirate AI
  - couldn't get certbot to work with different subdomains
- mostly worked 2 on front, 2 on back
  - rotated people every day
  - used live share
- they used confluence for logging
  - a lot of tech teams use confluence and jira : but these are heavy-duty tools


- pairing is typically more common since it's more time effective
  - mobbing is typically less common - it getes harder to justify the time for large groups to get together (paying for engineer's time)


- implementing subdomains for bin URLs:
  - certbot options - need to be careful when selecting
  - do 2 separate certificates:
    - 1 for wildcard subdomains
    - 1 for "base" domain


- human element of software engineering is pervasive
  - it's really important
  - coordinating among the team is really important

- for capstone projects and jobs:
  - you may think caches aren't interesting, but within that space, there might be some really interesting elements
  - need to keep an open mind about things
  - some job domains might not seem interesting (e.g., insurance industry might not be interesting, but from chatting with engineers, you may see that they're working on really interesting things)

- using the requestbin project for job search
  - generally, people don't show the requestbin project
  - generally, people might just have a screenshot
  - focus should be on capstone project:  recruiters have limited time, if you want people to focus on something, then its best to focus on capstone project

- job search
  - request bin project could be good to add
  - todo list app isn't good for resumes - "smells like bootcamp or tutorial"
  - trends:  not sure if requestbin or any small project should be included - it feels a bit too much like a "bootcamp"
    - there's a bit of a knee-jerk reaction to bootcamps
    - LS is similar to a bootcamp, but we're a bit different from typical bootcamps
  - not sure if having a personal website is worth having - it may be worth experimenting on not having a personal site
    - job hunt is very random;  sometimes you can't find patterns in the noise
      - may be best to just put your head down and put in the work
  - no need to lead with launchschool, better to lead with best foot
    - "I'm a software engineer" - here's my skillset
    - here's my capstone project as a follow-up


## Ryan Schaul (an engineering manager)
- works at SwipeSense (a subsidiary of SC Johnson)

- swipesense recently had a merger, infra is quite different
- has been at swipesense for 3 years, a bit longer since he graduated capstone
- has done some job mentoring
- used to be an attorney, started his own company for a bit, then went to launchschool

- swipesense : have products in hospitals, hand hygiene, washing compliance
  - install hardware - bluetooth signal, location hubs triangulate position of staff
  - soap, alcohol sensors
  - use the hardware on hand sanitizers, soap, etc.
  - all the sensors communicate and send data to a hub
  - then they process all of the raw data to see if people wash their hands
- can attach badges to assets, make sure nurses are doing rounds, patients are moving
- have hardware and software
- end product that customers care about is analytics

- infrastructure (legacy):
  - will merge with clean hands safe hands - both companies have approached things in different ways
  - microservices architecture
    - 1 part:  raw data processing
      - customer, VPN (via ec2) from com hub goes to AWS kinesis / firehose
        - handles data - very performant
      - batch processing on a fixed interval (maybe 1 sec or 1 mb first)
      - that data goes to S3 (storage bucket)
      - just simple data storage, like folders/file systems
      - just save the data for safe-keeping;  s3 is cheap, can put a lot in, for a long time
    - SNS message gets sent off when data is written
      - other services / logic - written in lambda - listen for these messages
      - variety of services:  app insights, hand hygiene, etc.
        - they take the raw data and do something intelligible with that data
        - process data
        - the result is written to a db (maybe sql, maybe nosql, dynamo db, etc.)
      - now data can be queried
    - all product apps are single page applications
      - these are hosted in s3 buckets
      - when they visit those pages, requests are made to a graphql layer
      - graphql can be hosted in any kind of app
      - graphql layer gives the front end exactly what it needs
- lots of different languages, frameworks, some services are node, python, ruby, lots of variety
  - lots of different jobs happening at the same time
- legacy clean hands / safe hands
  - written in php, laravel
  - monolithic
  - legacy swipesense started as ruby on rails
- strangler fig pattern
  - starting with monolith and moving to microservices
  - swipesense went through that strangler fig process
  - old ruby app is now the admin app (customers can update badges, etc.)
  - graphql layer is a ruby on rails app
    - they have 2 graphql layers
  - original founders did a separate graphql layer in go
    - go does facility assets - it is much faster
    - tech debt - it was an experiment that just sits there
    - it's been a pain - people forget that certain queries are in a different place

- a lot of infra is the result of tech debt
  - stuff that isn't ideal now, but may have been ideal in the past

- S3 is really cheap storage
  - holds raw data as it came from the hospitals
  - if there's ever a problem later
  - they have the raw data to re-build all the required events and data from it
  - it's kind of an insurance policy
- there's an event-driven services architecture
  - lambda - it just runs when there's something to do
- there is also a streaming transform process that happens in parallel

- 3 founders started the company, then sold the company to SC Johnson, all founders left
  - then 1 contractor was left who became a VP
  - there was a consulting company brought in
  - then Ryan was hired to help figure things out

- why SNS vs queue?
  - could use a queue, Clean Hands / Safe Hands legacy, they use queues to get through the data
  - SNS is often used for "fan-out" - if an event goes to multiple things
  - SQS is a "simple message queue" - worker takes things off the queue, but it's hard to fan out

- swipesense has a very small team
  - it's impossible to just work in 1 corner of the infra or company
  - need to bounce around a lot
    - it's a negative of microservices architecture with a samll team
  - he knows it well enough to talk about it at a high level
  - you'll surprise yourself - don't confuse familiarity with intelligence
    - think about things, go step by step and you'll eventually get it
    - once you spend some time with it, you'll get familiar


- why microservices?
  - (why migrate from monolith to microservices)
  - microservices scale better individually
    - especially when 1 aspect scales better
  - hard to go back to a monolith
  - lambdas are more flexible - separation of concerns
    - different tools can be employed for different jobs
  - monolith - can still use cloud, can still use queues, and hosting in cloud

- separate different services vs different pieces of infrastructure
  - you can still be a monolith and scale parts
  - neither option affects the ability to use the cloud

- there are 2 monoliths : 
  - also scaled on EC2 and kubernetes

- "microservices were hot"
  - b/c microservices were hot - it may have helped with the acquisition
  - the boss thinks this was probably a mistake
  - they just thought they needed to do it and they did it


- organizationally: Ryan thinks it was a mistake

- Cons to microservices:
  - something that is in memory that is moved "over the wire" - this creates partitions, retries, etc. DLQs, etc.
    - adds complexity
  - hard for a small team to manage - so many different pieces, different languages, etc.
    - with a small team working across a huge number of repos, languages, packages, maintenance (cognitive load, context switching, keeping packages up-to-date)
    - if you had a bigger team, it's probably more efficient for them - the separation of concerns matches the people
  - if you want to work on a service, need to read the readme (probably way out of date), try to spin it up locally, use docker
    - when you try and spin things up - there are errors, problems, etc.
    - getting the service up takes time
    - then you make a change
    - they use circle CI
    - things need to be updated, etc., then there are additional problems
    - then a test breaks
    - when you don't deal with things regularly, it's hard to remember what has to happen
  - you may think that services will all be the same, but they start to diverge and that makes things difficult
  - the amount of time you spend not on the code change balloons

  - it's also hard to hire people for this kind of company
    - it's not fun when you get bounced around a lot - it can be annoying
    - there are benefits (get good at problem solving)
    - it's hard to be an expert in a small company if you get bounced around
  - if you get a chance to go deeper, that can also be transferred
    - you develop a pattern for how things work and then do something different


- future discussion and combined bosses
  - the more we think about it, we should take the monolith
  - they talked about iti and it seemed to be better
  - clean hands had their original team, all of the swipesense hadn't built the thing
  - there were a lot of "corners" in the infrastructure that people hoped wouldn't break

- the microservices infra is also very expensive
  - on a per hospital bed basis, it's significantly more expensive


- monolith - clean hands safe hands
  - it was also deployed in the cloud
  - people talk about scaling all the time - how important is scaling?
  - for b2b hospital clients - it takes time, you see that ship coming, when you look at any of the metrics - it's relatively predictable

  - they just have a set number of boxes - 60/70% of the time - they just keep an eye on it
  - if they sign a new client, they add more compute

- kubernetes is very complicated
  - it's so overload for what they need
