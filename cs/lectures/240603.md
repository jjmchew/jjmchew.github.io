# June 3, 2024 - W5D1 - React

## History of React
- first front-end framework was Angular
  - prevent the DOM from changing the state
    - "two-way binding"
    - the DOM has a state
    - in angular, you could change state from DOM or programmatically from the code
    - Facebook encounted an issue when creating a chat application - how to determine "true" state of DOM if you can change it 2 ways?
    - the front-end has it's own state, distinct from the back-end
- in react (different paradigm from Angular):
  - can only change the state from the code - NOT the DOM
- between react and server : you can also look at differences in state
  - this will depend on the type of app you're building
  - if you need to send an async change to the db then you'll be subject to response time communicating with server


  - optimistic or pessimistic rendering
    - whether or not you update your front-end immediately and let the server update at it's own pace
    - optimistic:  can just update front-end and not wait for confirmation from db
      - your UI will feel "snappy"
    - pessimistic: will need to wait for update from the db since it's "critical" info
      - your UI may be slow - dependent on response time

- react introduced 1-way data binding and JSX

- using create-react-app or vite : both include a bunch of boilerplate code
  - this starts from "step 10" and you might not understand what you're getting
  - we'll start working with react from basics to see what's "under-the-hood"

## In-class demo
- start with nothing
- need an `index.html`
  - a basic HTML file
  - need to create a div with id 'root' to render the react app
- import stylesheets
- can import react from react CDN (if you don't have an npm project and can't import libraries, etc.) 
  - react 19 is beta
    - some new features like react compiler (can create optimizations, etc. for memoization, etc.)
  - currently react 18 is the "official" - none of those features will be available for our job search
    - assume for now that react 19 doesn't exist for our work
    - companies are still using react 16 since changing major versions can be painful

- need an index.js file for js code
  - to create react elements in js code (without jsx) use `React.createElement`

- now need to render the element to the page:
  - `const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');`
  - `ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement).render(App());`
  OR - `ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement).render(React.createElement(App));`

- `children` is always implicitly passed as a prop
  - it's a property of the prop object
  - you can always access this and use it
  - can be accessed through the second property passed into `.createElement`

- can assign "shorthand" to `.createElement`:
  - e.g., `const ce = React.createElement;`

- based upon given UI in index.html (old school HTML)
  - will convert that true HTML to `React.createElement` statements:

  ```javascript
  const ce = React.createElement;

  const App = () => {
    return ce("div", {className: 'comments', children: [ce('h2', null, "comments (2)", ce('div', {className:'parent-comment',
    children: [
      ce(Comment, {author: 'Srdjan', postedAt: '3 mins ago", body: 'Srdjan comment'}),
      ce(Comment),
      ce(Comment)
    ]
    }))]})
  }

  const Comment = ({author, postedAt, body}) => {
    return ce('div', {className: "comment", children: [
      ce('hr'),
      ce('div', [className: "image", children: [
        ce('img', {src: 'https://etc'})
      ]),
      ce('div', {className: 'header', children: [
        ce('h3', {className: 'author'}, author),
        ce('span', null, postedAt)
      ]}),
      ce('p', null, body)
    ]})
  }

  const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');
  ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement).render(ce(App));
  ```

- to make comments dynamic, need to pass props with dynamic data in it
- if desired, can pass multiple children in as an array of children, or comma separated arguments in `React.createElement`


### dependencies with creating a new project
- `npm init -y`
- typicaly dependencies:
  - eslint
  - react
  - react-dom
  - prettier

- need to create `.eslintrc.json` (this is legacy syntax)
  - typically this is defined by vite
  ```javascript
  {
    "extends": [
      "eslint: recommended",
      "prettier"  // must go last
    ],
    "rules": {  // can be used to overwrite rules

    },
    "plugins": [],
    "parserOptions": {
      "ecmaVersion": "latest",
      "sourceType": "module"
    },
    "env": {
      "browser": true,
      "node": true,
      "es6": true
    }
  }
  ```

- next install a 'bundler'
  - vite uses esbuild for dev, rollup for prod
  - create-react-app used webpack
  - Srdjan used Parcel as a bundler

- **bundler**
  - will combine all modules into a single file
  - minifies
  - does hot-reload (for dev server)
  - transpiles code so that browser can understand it (using babel)

- note that vite is NOT a bundler - it uses a different bundler under the hood



- add `package.json` scripts
  - 'start' and 'test' script does not require use of 'run', i.e., can use `npm start`
  - when using parcel:
    - `"dev": "parcel src/index.html"` : define a script which runs parcel and passes in a parameter with index.html
    - parcel requires that script tags in html have `type='module'` included
      - i.e, `<script type='module' src='index.js'></script>`
  - parcel uses a cache, which helps it to run quickly

- webpack can be very difficult - often people don't touch those configs once they are created
  - it can be difficult
  - need to be aware of what webpack does


- remember the difference between default exports and named exports

  - a named export needs to be specifically named
    - can use `import { funcName as newName } from './funcFile.js'`
  - a default export can be called anything
  - should generally use ES6 imports
    - with node, there will be some additional setup to be able to use ES6 imports "out-of-the-box"
    - need to add 'type': 'module' in `package.json`
    - for testing, need to use babel to convert to commonJS

  - also remember difference between ES6 and commonJS modules


- the `dist` folder is created after using parcel
  - the js files within the dist folder contains all of the combined libraries defined in package.json
    - it puts the entire library into your build
    - 64 lines of code became 26000+ lines of code
      - using too many libraries is SLOW
      - remember what the client needs
        - could lazy load, etc.
        - or move things to dev dependencies
        - etc.
    - when minified, will be slightly smaller

  - build for prod will contain only prod, build for dev will contain everything



## misc
- we'll use vitetest for front and back
  - the syntax is very similar to jest
    - if you know vitetest, you should be able to use jest relatively easily
    - the concept is similar
  - it pairs well with vite
  - jest is external to vite
