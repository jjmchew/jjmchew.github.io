# June 4, 2024 W5D2 - React

## Misc
- when first react came out, people didn't like JSX and some people said that you should use React.createElement
- now, JSX is pretty common, but remember that it's all just JS under-the-hood

- when you use vite, can create a new "front" or "client" folder

## Splitting an app into components
- always an "it depends"
- there are clearly wrong answers:
  - to put everything into 1 file
  - to put everything tag / elements into single components
    - makes it hard to maintain the app
    - think about state/props

- can split things visually
  - e.g., see: https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react

- can also split by functionality
  - put forms into different components
    - forms have their own state
  - put lists into their own component
  - also split things by reusability
    - hard to see in small apps and take-home projects
    - if a component might be re-used, definitely it should be a single component

## Changing the HTML to react (Comments app)
- create new vite app
- cut and paste the index.html into the return statement of the App
  - remove all of the boilerplate
- change 'class' to 'className'
- change rows, cols into integers (i.e., need to put in `{}` and remove double-quotes)

- can start to split major components

- can use react snippets:
  - e.g., 'sfc' : stateless functional components

- create new components files, cut the appropriate parts, paste into the return statement
  - comment w/ replies - could be a component: a "thread"

  - when there are multiples of a single component:
    - can create an array of imaginary values to map over and return the multiple components

- if you don't have a key prop:
  - react will destroy that part of the dom tree and re-build the whole list
  - this is inefficient - working with DOM is slow
  - in react, you work with a virtual DOM (an object): operations are fast
  - changing the dom and rebuilding it is slow
  - with the key prop, react will only change the elements of the dom tree that are different

- key usually should be an id - something unique
  - anything in an array needs to have a key


### Adding types
- often put into a "types" folder
- can think about common elements of data objects

```typescript
export interface Comment {
  id: string;
  author: string;
  body: string;
  postedAt: number;
}

export interface Reply extends Comment {
  comment_id: string;
}

export interface CommentWithReplies extends Comment {
  replies_count: number;
  replies: Reply[];
}
```


- for useState:
  - always start with an empty array - the type must match any subsequent operations on the state variable


- by convention, prop types are always defined with the component, not in a separate file
- may need to import types using 'as':
  - e.g., `import { Comment as CommentType } from '../types';`
  - `interface Comments Props extends CommentType {}` : this indicates that will take some or all of the types we want

  - convention is to explicitly declare Props of the component, so even if the types are the same as a general type, it's best to explicitly define Props




## useEffect and useState demos
- could use `useState` or `useReducer` to keep track of state
  - typically, will use `useState`

- `useEffect` - performs side effects
  - most common is interacting with a server
  - first argument is callback, 2nd argument indicates when the callback should be run

demo on useEffect
```javascript
function App() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    setCounter(5);
    console.log(counter); # 2. this displays 0
  }, []);
  console.log(counter);  # 1. this first displays 0
                         # 3. then it displays 5
  return (
    <div>
      <p>The counter value is {counter}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

```
- in React strict mode and in dev mode, there will be some additional renders (things will run twice), in chrome these re-renders will be greyed out
  - essentially everything wrapped by the "App" will be re-run
  - from Troy:  the re-running the useEffect ensures that clean-up is happening in dev mode


- demonstrates mounting and unmounting
  - mount and render is the same - the first time it renders it mounts
    - subsequently it is just a re-render
  - unmount - remove from DOM

```javascript
function App() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setCounter(5);  #  this will take 1.5 s for screen to redraw
    }, 1500);
    console.log(counter); # 2. this displays 0
  }, []);
  console.log(counter);  # 1. this first displays 0
                         # 3. then it displays 5
  return (
    <div>
      {counter > 4 && counter < 10 ? <Header /> : null}
      <p>The counter value is {counter}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>Click me!</button>
    </div>
  );
}

```

- when updating a state based on a previous state then you MUST use an updating function
  - i.e., `setCounter(counter => counter + 1)` vs `setCounter(counter + 1)`


- in the example below:
  - react will batch updates to state
  - if you click the counter 20 times, the counter will never get to 20 if you don't use an updating function
    - anytime you update state based upon a previous state, you must use this callback function
    - with objects, the same rules apply - can't mutate objects
    - need to use Object.assign or use Array.concat so that React knows that something has changed

  - if you use an updater function, then the state will eventually reach the desired number of clicks
    - "callback function passed to a setter hook"
    - the term "updater function" may be a Srdjan thing


```javascript
function App() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      {counter > 4 && counter < 10 ? <Header /> : null}
      <p>The counter value is {counter}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setTimeout(() => setCounter(counter + 1), 300)}>Click me!</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```


## Hooks flow
- see Srdjan's demo app:
  - parent and child components
  - parent toggles appearance of child
  - child has a counter for update

- google: react hook flow diagram
- the order of things which happen on each phase of a component lifecycle
- mount: first render
- update: subsequent renders
- unmount: when you remove it from the dom


- lazy initializers:  we won't use them here - it's unlikely we'll use them in take-home projects or on the job
  - these are callback functions passed to useState
  - these are used for heavy computations (complex math, reading from local storage, etc.)
    - don't get local state on every re-render
    - hence the lazy initializers


- render:  function starts executing code from top to bottom


- react updates DOM - TBD
  - committing is make the changes to the DOM
  - the object which is the DOM is first updated, but then the screen is updated later


- LayoutEffects:
  - it's a `useLayout` effect
  - we might not see it in the wild:
  - similar to useEffect, but changes the layout of the page
  - e.g., an app with a lot of scrolling
    - when the page re-renders, want the page to be at the bottom since the user was last there
    - if you don't use useLayoutEffects, then there would be a glitch - it would first render at the top and then go to the bottom
    - it will show the bottom of the screen first before it renders the top
- browser paints screen:
  - this is when things are displayed on-screen
- useEffect runs AFTER things are first shown on the screen
  - if changing state then the app will always render twice


- browser paints screen is when the DOM gets updated
  - the return statement is what gets painted to the screen


- useEffect can also return a function
  - the function that is returned is called a "clean-up effect"
  - these are typically used in larger applications
    - this prevents memory leaks, prevents data corruption from stale data
    - most common thing is to abort a request to the server
      - if the component unmounts, you definitely don't want that request to keep going
      - if the response isn't received yet and the component needs to unmount for whatever reason, then you would cancel the request
    - this clean-up runs first before the useEffect runs to cancel anything from a PREVIOUS effect


- unmount :  need to clean-up effects and then remove component

- first paint screen for both components
  - then run useEffects
  - if a useEffect is run on mount, then the clean-up will only run on unmount
  - useEffects for children will run first (deepest in the hierarchy) and then bubble up to the useEffect for the parent
    - clean-ups first, then actual useEffects

- when state is updated, then the component where state has changed and any nested children will also update
  - the parent doesn't update

- for child:  all clean-up useEffects will be run when the component is unmounted

- if possible, should try and push state as low as possible - to reduce the number of re-renders
  - if many components are using that state, then it will have to be at the top of a hierarchy
  - generally try to push state to leaf components
