# June 5, 2024 W5D3 - React

## Misc
- by Thurs aft we should send our shopping cart to Srdjan for review
- we need a repo to share to review code for conventions, etc.


## Review hooks flow
- order of console.logs when app first mounts:
  - parent start
  - parent end
  - mount useeffect
  - isChildShown useEffect

- console.logs when "show child" is clicked
  - see chart
  - render all components first
  - clean-up effects for all (parent first, since child is mounted, no clean-up)
  - use-effects for all (child first, then parent)

- when we click 'count' (in child)
  - parent doesn't update (state doesn't change)
  - child start
  - child end
  - count useEfect cleanup
  - count useEffect

- when we unmount child (click show child)
  - renders (everything, parent first):
    - parent start
    - parent end
    - child start
    - child end
  - clean-up effects (lowest child first):
    - child unmount
    - child count
    - parent isChildShown
  - useEffects (lowest child first):
    -- parent isChildShown


- if you try to set state in a useEffect and nothing is on the screen, then you'll get an error
  - default state is always used first

- when you update a state based on a previous state, you must use a dispatch function
  - i.e, `setCount(prevState => prevState + 1)`
  - "dispatch" : means to set a state



## Comment app example
- can use the library "moment"
  - display `moment(postedAt).fromNow()`
- since both front-end and back-end use localhost (different ports)
  - will need CORS

- for vite:
  - vite.config.ts:  add 'server' / 'proxy' key
  ```
  server: {
    proxy: {
      "/api": {
        target: 'http://localhost:3001",
      },
    },
  }
  ```
- each tool, e.g., create-react-app  will set up proxies differently
  - for parcel, it will also be a different method (see Srdjan's summary on setting up parcel)


### adding server calls
  - Srdjan uses axios
  - useEffect expects that the callback will return undefined or a clean-up function
    - useEffect cannot be async since it will return a promise
  - to use async functions within useEffect:
    - can use an IIFE
    - or just define an async function within the useEffect and then call it

  - don't forget to start the server!

### get more replies
  - don't mix conventions
    - e.g., passing setters for some props and not others
    - e.g., don't mix ESModules and CommonJS modules


  - 2 ways to do it:
    1. define a handler function in the app component and pass them down as props (all logic to get data, etc will be in App)
      - define a function in App 'onMoreReplies' (will be essentially the same function as 'handleMoreReplies' as described below)
      - pass this function down the prop chain to CommentThread
      - in CommentThread, create a 'handleMoreReplies'
        - this will accept the event, can use `e.preventDefault()`
        - then invoke `onMoreReplies`
      
      - when there are only 2 lines in the function, don't need to define a separate helper function
        - can also define it directly into the onClick definition within the JSX



    2. pass down both state and setter hook to where you need it and perform the async action where you need it
      - will need to fix the TS issues
      - setter functions are type `Dispatch<SetStateAction<CommentWithReplies[]>>`
        - `Dispatch` and `SetStateAction` need to be imported from 'react'

      - create a 'handleMoreReples' function
        - this function updates ALL comments, but adds the additional comments where the link was clicked
        - should be an async function:
        ```javascript
        const handleMoreReplies = async(e: React.SyntheticEvent) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          try {
            const { data } = await axios.get('/api/comment_replies?comment_id=${comment.id})
            setComments(prevState => {
              return prevState.map(c => {
                if (c.id === comment.id) {
                  return {...c, replies: c.replies.concat(data)}
                }
                return c;
              });
            })
          }
        }
        ```
      - then need to use a ternary to hide the link "show more replies"


- passing a function as a prop:
  - convention is to use "handle..." or "on...."
  - convention when passing setters:  leave it as "set..."
  
### Using forms
- create state for each input field
- set input tags to have value equal to the state var
  - and add onChange handler:  `onChange={e => setAuthor(e.target.value)}`

- create onSubmit action
  - create 'handleSubmit' function (as per convention 1 above)
  ```javascript
  const handleSubmit = async (newComment) => {
    try {
    const { data } = await axios.post('/api/comments', {...newComment});
    setComments(prevState => prevState.concat(data))
    } catch (e) {
      console.log(e);
    }
  }
  ```
  - pass "onSubmit" prop to AddCommentsForm component
    - type:  `onSubmit: (newComment) => void`
  - create handleSubmit function in AddCommentsForm
  ```javascript
  const handleSubmit = (e: React.SyntheticEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const comment = {author, body};
    onSubmit(comment);
  }
  ```
  - will need to create a new type for NewComment:
  ```typescript
  export interface NewComment extends Omit<Comment, "id" | "postedAt"> {}
  ```

- to clear the form after form is submitted:
  - could create a `reset` function with `setAuthor('') and setBody('')`
    - could just invoke that function after the `onSubmit`
  - it's better to not reset data right away since `onSubmit` involves an async action
    - better to not just delete form data until after you receive confirmation from the db
    - if request fails, data should remain in the form
  - can only reset if the request succeeds
    - easiest to *pass the rest function as a callback* to App.handleSubmit
    - can make that callback optional
      - then invoke the callback within the App handleSubmit once the db call is successful
    - having 'onSubmit' return a value is NOT a common pattern
      - handlers should never return a meaningful value - they just perform async actions



### Services
- generally it's a good practice to move all the db access in a services file
  - e.g., `comments.ts`
    - will contain axios import
    - will export getComments
    - will export getReplies
    - will export createComment


- generally, Srdjan leaves the error handling in the component
  - he doesn't move it to services
  - will include an error state and a ternary in the return statement to display an error message





## HW
- split into components
- connect to db
  - could also set products in the backend using postman
- create add product form
  - populate data in the db
