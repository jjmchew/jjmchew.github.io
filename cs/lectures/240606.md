## Handling errors (React)
- create an 'error' state variable (boolean)
- once you catch the error (i.e., in catch block), `setError(true)`
- in return statement: `if (error) return <FourOhFour />`

- validation and designing schemas:
  - can use a library 'zod' to define what the response should look like from the api
  - `npm install zod`
  - this library also works for form validation

  - this library is used in production
  - we should use this library if we're using TS
    - zod adds runtime type safety, while TS adds compile time safety
    - typescript can use the info we define in zod to help better infer types within our code
    - zod will actually look at the properties of the returned object to confirm that the properties and types match
    - with TS, you can define the type, but you can't be sure without actually checking the object


  ```javascript
  import {z} from 'zod';

  // just need to define the properties of the api data that are being used
  const replySchema = z.object({
    id: z.string(),
    comment_id: z.string(),
    author: z.string(),
    body: z.string(),
    postedAt: z.number()//.optional() can also be added
  });

  const commentSchema = z.object{
    id: z.string(),
    author: z.string(),
    body: z.string(),
    postedAt: z.number(),
    replies_count: z.number(),
    replies: z.array(replySchema)
  };

  const getCommentsResponseSchema = z.array(commentSchema);
  const getRepliesResponseSchema = z.array(replySchema);

  // to use:
  return getCommentsResponseSchema.parse(data);

  // alternative syntax for typing (with destructuring - defines the type of property data)
  const { data } = await axios.get<{data: CommentWithReplies[]}>('/api/comments');

  // Handling ZodErrors
  if (e instanceof ZodError) {
    // handle specific ZodError this way
  }
  ```

  - for take-home projects, it's generally expected to use typescript and Zod
    - definitely best to do
    - you could add UUIDs to the project
    - you should write down all the things you WOULD add if you had more time, etc.
    - also write down design decisions (e.g., like not exposing UUIDs)
    - don't let interviewers make assumptions / wrong assumptions
