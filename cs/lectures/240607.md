# June 7, 2024 W5D5 - React

## Misc
- mandatory homework is very important - writing test using mocks
  - it's critical for any testing
  - if you have to test anything in take-home tests, you will have to do mocking
  - take-home projects are very common during job hunt
  - take-home projects are almost guaranteed
  - understanding how to mock is critical


## React - click spamming bug
- generally, if things make sense and the code you think is a problem isn't a problem, then you probably have to look elsewhere
- the issue is the conditional `if (existingItem)`
  - `setCartItems` is async - it doesn't finish setting the state
    - the cart is empty and existingItem is evaluated as always evaluated as false when 'Add to Cart' button is pushed each time
    - evaluating the cart to see if an item exists MUST be inside the dispatch function based upon the previous state

- debugging guidelines:
  - if you understand built-in functions
  - if the code you've created makes sense
  - then you need to look outside of the code you're trying to debug
    - the problem is likely to be somewhere else


## Testing
- will use React testing library
  - now a default for testing react apps
  - react testing library and vite are becoming more popular
  - vitetest is a test runner
    - gives methods and assertion functions
    - like jest
    - creates, runs tests
  - react testing library
    - is specifically made to test your react apps
    - gives methods to render to virtual dom and access specific elements of that dom
    - since react runs in the browser, and you don't have a browser for tests, you can use the library to test what happens
- this kind of testing will render the entire app (virtually)
  - but it's similar to unit testing, even though the entire app is being rendered
- end 2 end testing would be testing the entire app:
  - e.g., user clicks on this, user types something to login, user sees their profile, etc.
- will work on mocking on Monday

- react-testing-library
  - you should test how the user is interacting with the app and what the user sees
    - e.g., look for an h2 tag that the user sees

  - NOT like enzyme - don't test for the existence of elements by class, etc.
    - it doesn't matter if a div with class 'input-group' exists
    - generally don't create test attributes with specific ids and test if they exist with 'getByTestid', but it's not the ideal approach for react-testing-library
    




## Example project

### Setup
- `npm i --save-dev vitest jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event @testing-library/jest-dom`
- could be installed as dev dependencies - don't need to be full dependencies

- `package.json` scripts:
  ` "test": "vitest",`
  - `"test:watch": "vitest --watch"`

- setup typescript:
  - `tsconfig.json`: 
    - add under compilerOptions: `"types": ["vitest/globals", "@testing-library/jest-dom/vitiest"]`

- setup jestdom
  - create `setupTests.ts` file:
    - `import "@testing-library/jest-dom"`

- `vite.config.ts`
  - should also be defined within the vite docs

  - add first line `/// <reference types="vitest" />`
  - add:
  ```javascript
  test: {
      globals: true,
      environment: "jsdom",
      setupFiles: ["./setupTests.ts"],
  },
  ```

- it's great to create a boilerplate for setting up these tests so that it's handy for take-home projects


### Test file
- create `AddCommentsForm.test.tsx`

```typescript
import AddCommentsForm from './AddCommentsForm';
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';  // use this one, not "fire event"

const mockSubmit = vi.fn(); // we'll talk about on Monday

// render is required to create the virtual DOM
// screen is recommended to access methods to find elements in the dom (find by text, row, label, etc.)
//  it's also recommended (by library creator) to not destructure screen and just refer to it using 'screen. '

describe('AddCommentsForm', () => {
  it('contains an h2 heading', () => {
    // render to (virtual) dom
    render(<AddCommentsForm onSubmit={mockSubmit} />)
    // find element you want to test
    const heading = screen.getByRole('heading', {level: 2});
    // assertion
    expect(heading).toBeInTheDocument(); // expect is from vitetest;  .toBeInTheDocument method is from jest-dom library
  });

  it('changes the input state of the author', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    render(<AddCommentsForm onSubmit={mockSubmit} />);

    const inputAuthor = screen.getByRole('textbox', {name: 'Your Name'});

    await user.type(inputAuthor, 'Srdjan')
    expect(inputAuthor).toHaveValue('Srdjan'); // assertion
  });

  it('changes the input state of the body', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    render(<Add...>)
    const inputBody = screen.getByRole('textbox', {name: 'Your Comment'});
    await user.type(inputBody, 'Whatever I want');
    expect(inputBody).toHaveValue('Whatever I want');
  });
});

```
- using describe block is optional (a convention / design choice)
  - Ken thinks you shouldn't use describe blocks
- `it` or `test` are equivalent

- to get elements for testing
  - convention is to use `getByRole` (e.g., heading has a heading role, etc)
    - these are defined by accessibility
    - need to google and learn these roles
    - react-testing-library is based around accessibility
    - e.g., buttons shouldn't be links (it's not accessible)
    - hence, they want you to find elements using roles for different elements (they generally make sense)

    - note:  role `textbox` is for `input` tags
    - note:  you need to include `htmlFor` attribute for `label` elements which relate to an `id` of the corresponding `input`


  - if you can't use `getByRole`, then can use `getByText`

```typescript
import CommentThread from './CommentThread';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';

const mockReplies = vi.fn();
const mockComment = {
  id: "...",
  // etc. cut and paste from sample data
};

describe('commentThread', () => {
  it('contains show more replies', () => {
    render(<CommentThread onMoreReplies={mockReplies} comment={mockComment} />)
    const link = screen.getByRole('link', {name: /Show More Replies/}); // uses Regex for match
    expect(link).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

- most difficult part of testing is testing API interactions
- testing of the React element should be relatively basic
  - i.e,. if you type something, it should show up, etc.

- testing layout / css - probably easiest using snapshots

- react-testing-library is more about logical changes that reflect what users see



## Srdjan's setup notes
1. Run `npm i -D vitest jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event @testing-library/jest-dom`

2. In package.jsonm scripts add `"test": "vitest"`

3. Create `setupTests.ts` file

```ts file="setupTests.ts"
import "@testing-library/jest-dom";
```

4. Update `vite.config.ts` file

```ts
/// <reference types="vitest" />  is a special syntax used in TypeScript known as a triple-slash directive. Specifically, this directive is used to include type declarations from a specific packageâ€”in this case, vitest. Because vite

import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: "jsdom",
    setupFiles: ["./setupTests.ts"],
  },
  server: {
    proxy: {
      "/api": {
        target: "http://localhost:3001",
        changeOrigin: true,
        secure: false,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

5. In `tsconfig.json` In compiler options add `"types": ["@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest", "vitest/globals"],`



## HW
- video on mocking is the most important
  - watch the video, then try and implement on your own if you have time

- Monday - we'll mock
- Tues / Wed - lectures
- Thurs / Fri - will give take home project(s)
    - the provided html/css will have some issues
