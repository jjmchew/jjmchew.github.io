# Sun June 9, 2024 - Mock interview with Garrett

- Garrett gave me this problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/description/

- python:  remember to import 'Math' module to use the ceil function
  - could also have created a helper function to take care of Math.ceil
- good vocalizing and explaining my thinking - especially the test cases - tables worked well
- ask for more help to clarify assumptions (I wrote down the question, but I never asked)
  - e.g., they might leave you in the dark, or they might help
- make sure I review conditional 



- Garrett's practice problem (I gave to him):
https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/
- great knowledge of Python syntax - copy.deepcopy, insert
- good catch on conditional error
