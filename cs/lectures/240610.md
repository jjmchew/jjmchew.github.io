# Mon June 10, 2024 (W6D1) - React

## Misc
- dummyjson website - provides testing data for front-end code testing
- can check cors-anywhere:
  - can prepend `https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/${desired http url}` to address cors issues


## Testing

- this test below will fail (which has as an API call to a back-end to return data which contains 'Emily')
  - the async call to the API finishes AFTER the test finishes (running synchronously)

```ts
import { render, screen} from '@testing-library/react1';
import App from './App';

describe('App', () => {
  it('shows heading 1 with Emily in it', () => {
    render(<App/>);
    const heading = screen.getByRole('heading', {level: 1, name: 'Emily'});
    expect(heading).toBeInDocument();
  });
});
```

- need to use a different method to 'waitFor'
  - this method is *findByRole*
- this version of the test will PASS (since it needs to wait for data from API endpoint)
```ts
import { render, screen} from '@testing-library/react1';
import App from './App';

describe('App', () => {
  it('shows heading 1 with Emily in it', async () => {
    render(<App/>);
    const heading = screen.findByRole('heading', {level: 1, name: 'Emily'}); // Note use of 'findByRole' (async)
    expect(heading).toBeInDocument();
  });
});
```

- for the example, Srdjan is testing using an external API since he wasn't sure if proxying from the react app to testing might work
  - the demo above was getting around 'js-dom' using 'cors-anywhere'
  - vite does not do the testing, it's done with vitest
    - setting up a proxy for testing is more difficult - you may not be able to proxy to localhost for testing
    - shouldn't be proxying from test anyway - i.e., shouldn't be actually sending out the network request as part of testing
      - if the order changes, or there is a network failure, then the test might not pass, but it's NOT a code issue
      - hence, should separate concerns (i.e., network from code testing)
      - tests will be slow (b/c of the network)
      - you will also be implicitly testing whether the API is up
        - this is distinct from testing whether or not the APP shows the name on-screen once received
        - any service on a different PORT (i.e., a db, a cache, etc.) should all be mocked
        - CAUTION: don't need to mock the function you are trying to test within the app
          - only mock functions that you are importing (e.g., services, API calls, etc.) - don't need to mock stuff within the function you are testing


  - instead of sending a request to the server, you should be mocking instead
  - i.e., "your tests should work offline" - this is a hint that you should be mocking

### Mocking

```typescript
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react';
import App from './App';

import * as commentsService from './services/comments'; 
// importing the above w/ a namespace 'commentsService' makes it much easier to define types for Typescript - hence everything is imported

vi.mock('./services/comments.ts');
const mockedCommentService = vi.mocked(commentsService, true);
// line above is for typescript, it returns types for the mocked functions (not necessary for js, and functions can be imported separately instead of using '*')

const mockedComments = [
  {
    id: "...",
    comment_id: "...",
    author: "...",
    // etc.  this is copied from the mockData
  }
];

const mockedReplies: Reply [] = [
  {
    'id': '...',
    'comment_id': '...',
    // etc.  this will be copied from mockData
  }
];


describe('App', () => {
  afterEach(() => {
    vi.resetAllMocks();  // makes each test independent
  });

  it('contains heading l3 with author name', async () => {
    // need to mock before rendering
    mockedCommentService.getComments.mockResolvedValueOnce(mockedComments);
    render(<App/>);
    const heading = await screen.findByRole('heading', {level: 3, name: 'Reed Fisher'});
    expect(heading).toBeInTheDocument();
  });


  it('displays additional replies when Show More Replies is clicked', async () => {
    mockedCommentService.getComments.mockResolvedValueOnce(mockedComments); // this should be replicatd to make tests independent
    mockedCommentService.getReplies.mockedResovledValue(mockedReplies);
    render(<App/>);
    const link = await screen.findByRole('link', {name: /Show More Replies/});
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    await user.click(link);
    const replyAuthor = await screen.findByRole('heading', {level: 3, name: /Sean/});
    expect(replyAuthor).toBeInTheDocument(); // you can add additional assertions, but it's not ideal since you're not sure why this particular test might have failed if there are 2 assertions in this test
    expect(link).no.toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});


```
- note:  all services that are mocked (note the `import * as ...` need mocked responses)
- if defining mock responses, that data may need to be typed (i.e., empty arrays will need to be defined as types from our types file, etc.)

- "*act*" error from testing:
  - this occurred when I was rendering the screen but not waiting for any async calls that were required to complete
    - i.e., my test function was not async and I was not using "findByRole" to ensure that any async calls would complete prior to running the test assertion (I was using 'getByRole' since I assumed those elements would appear on-screen)
  - although my tests didn't fail (the inputs were displayed on-screen, regardless) a warning was given since there was the potential that those inputs might be dependent on the unfinished async calls which occurred during component mount


- would use `mockResolvedValueOnce` for chaining values
- when testing anything that involves state - you should test the component which "owns" that state
  - in our example above, `App` component contains state, hence you should test at the `App` level
  - you don't want to have to manually re-render the app to test
    - hence, for components that receive state as props, you would not want to test below
    - for those lower components, those tests are very low level - you test that when different props are provided, the screen displays those props
  - testing at the higher level where you interact with server data is more important
  - pick an element (e.g., the h3 heading) that validates that the correct info is being received from the server and that the correct data set is being displayed
    - don't need to set ALL of the data that is returned from the server in the same set
    - important to test something that is representative
    - testing whether or not ALL data is displayed on screen is a bit less important now with TypeScript since you'll see compile time errors if you have typos or you don't include all props, etc.
    - i.e., clicking the button to see if a form shows, just need to pick 1 representative element from the form to confirm that the form is displayed
      - can be reasonably confident that if the form appears then all parts of it will appear

  - this type of testing is a partly unit testing, partially integration testing
    - need to render the entire App to test the app, so it's a kind of integration testing (since other components are being rendered as part of that testing)

- may need to use `queryByRole` - to test if something appears and disappears on the screen
  - `getByRole` may return errors



#### Testing "style"

- tests are executed in the order in which they are written in the file (not executed in random order)
  - should still try to make sure that tests are independent
  - hence inclusion of 'afterEach' to make each test independent
    - i.e,. clear mocks from prior tests to ensure that tests work in isolation



- using `afterEach` vs `beforeEach`:
  - it's often better if there aren't many lines of set-up code that it be included within each test
    - if there are a lot of tests, then you'd have to scroll up to see the setup (which if it's short, could just be replicated)


- for a take-home project:
  - don't need to demonstrate X% coverage of the app
  - typically, just trying to demonstrate competency and understanding of the testing process


- companies will have different expectations around testing and how to structure tests
  - just keep in mind the clearly WRONG things (i.e., not mocking api data)

- keeping tests very specific and separating different types of assertions into independent tests makes it easier to understand when tests fail
  - if you have to figure out why a test failed, then you've probably got too many assertions in 1 test

- mock data:
  - best to keep mocked data as simple as possible:
    - only include the minimum necessary to understand and make the test relevant
      - e.g., unneeded object properties shouldn't be include
      - e.g., test data (like IDs) can be simplified (if not relevant to the test)
  - could even define that mocked data within the test itself to make it easy to understand and debug if a test fails





## In-class today
- implement testing (with mocking) for
  - get products
  - adding product
  - toggling of edit form (appears and disappears properly)
  - deleting product
