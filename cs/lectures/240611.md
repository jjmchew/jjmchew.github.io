## Scaling React Applications
- what does it mean for a react app to scale?
  - a lot of state
  - the ways that state might change
  - the number of components (could have 1000s of components in a large production app)
  - you may have a "view layer" (the component) and state (the "model") and want to separate those 2 things

  - lots of components
  - lots of state
  - fetching remote data (will add complexity)
  - data that changes frequently


- Why do we care?
  - *performance*
  - more JS means bigger bundle sizes, more work in the browser, more frequent / longer network calls
  - maintainability:
    - how easy is it for people who are unfamiliar with a codebase to maintain, update / change code


## Demo 1
- https://random-data-api.com/api/v2/users

- start with a standard vite application (TS template)

### Basic app
- objective:
  - grab a random user from API link above
  - display the name, skills, avatar

- uses TS and zod (to validate data at runtime)
  - userSchema - maps to subset of API data that we care about
  - `type User = z.infer<typeof userSchema>;`


### Refresh page with a button
- next objective:  don't want to have to refresh the page
  - create a button which will make a call to the API and render a new user on-screen

  - move `fetchUser` function out of useEffect and then create a button which has an onClick which executes `fetchUser`



  - it's a simple solution- *but* the name of the user will change
    before the avatar image will change
    - why doesn't the image disappear and it just changes later
    - the API sends us a URL to the new avatar image
    - there is a 2nd network call and a latency while that new image is being received
      - it feels like we're in-between states for a brief moment: new text but old image
    - *issue*: when react re-renders the component, React compares the virtual DOM to the existing DOM and makes only the minimal changes that it has to
      - the image element doesn't need to be re-created, the source attribute is swapped in
      - the old image element isn't destroyed, the source is just swapped in and then a network request is issued
      - the new image isn't updated until the image is received
  
    - *solution*:  
      - **best solution**:  use key attribute in that img tag
        - this tells React that the img will have changed
      - another possible solution could be to add state:
        - that's not ideal since the state would be duplicated (the url is already in state)



### Create an artifical delay to highlight network latency
- within fetchUser:
  - just add an await Promise with a 1500 ms `setTimeout`

### Add loading spinner
- add new state:  `isLoading` (boolean)
- in `fetchUser`
  - before we fetch `setIsLoading(true)`
  - after fetch (in a `finally` block) `setIsLoading(false)`

- react schedules state changes
  - so change of state at start of `fetchUser` is separate from the completion of the useEffect



- can we wait to show the user component until after the image has also been received?
  - need to use a ref to track the state of the network request of the image
  - once the second request resolves, you can display both
  - need to use a useRef
  - often you may use an image component from a component library (e.g., Next.js, etc.) - that component will help to abstract away complicated logic like that


### Handling network errors
- will create simulated errors:
  - create a function which random creates an error string and modifies the API url 30% of the time to simulate errors

- now nothing is displayed if there's an error

- show an error component:
  - need to create an `error` state (boolean)
  - in `fetchUser` at the start:
    - add `setError(false)`
    - in the `catch` block:  `setError(true)`
  
  - add early return (`if (isError)`) to display error component
  - error component includes messages and a button to retry


#### problems with the code
- the code is "brittle" (easy to break)
  - won't throw obvious errors

- the order of early returns:
  - i.e., `if (isLoading)` comes before `if (isError)`
    - hence, if there is an error AND it was last re-loading
    - in an error, the isLoading will remain and error will not be shown

- MUST remember to `setIsError(false)` at the start of `fetchUser`
  - otherwise, app will remain in an error state if it crops up

- *key problem*:
  - all states are related;  `isLoading`, `error`, `user`
    - if an user exists, then shouldn't have an error, and shouldn't be `isLoading`
  
  - could combine all states into a large object as separate properties
    - then, set all states at the same time
     - still requires that a developer truly understands how the states should be set and managed
     - this still makes the code "brittle"

  - best to remove state logic from the component and just "consume" it
    - rather than deal with having to make the changes


### implement useReducer
- useReducer adds complexity
- if you have multiple pieces of state that are dependent, then you useReducer is the answer
  - shopping carts are a very common usecase for useReducer
  - move control of the changes in state from the component to a "state change" function


- *remember*: useState and useReducer are both local state
  - useState is just a simplified version of useReducer
  - syntax is different:
    - argument to setter functions is NOT the next state
    - argument to setter function is the argument to reducer function
    - return value of reducer function is the new state

- you can replicate `useState` almost exactly using `useReducer`
  - just replace the dispatch function with the new state value that should be set

- reducer functions take:
  - current state
  - action
    - an action object which has:
      - type: a string
      - a payload: optional data which may be included for state
  - it returns the new state

  - need to define interface for various action types
  - reducer function typically uses `switch` statement to manage various cases
    - common to include a `default` block to manage potential errors


### Changes to align with conventions
- create a reducers folder and put the `userReducer` in a separate file

- rename reducer function to 'dispatch'

- use "action creators":
  - the user now doesn't need to know what the correct type string is to make a state change
  - that action creator just returns an object



### Add data from the beer api
- could extract all logic from user component to be able to generalize it to beer, as well

- could use a custom hook to extract a pattern of state and effects and make it reusable

- create a new directory `hooks` which contains
  - `useFetch.tsx`
  - this file defines type `FetchState<T>` : a generic type for state
  - define type `FetchAction<T>`
  - define `useFetch` custom hook
    - accepts parameters: `url: string`, `schema? ZodSchema<T>`
  - include logic for `fetchData` async function
  - return `[state, fetchData]`


- in `useFetch` custom hook:
  - need `useCallback` to memoize the `fetchData` function since it's now a dependency in the `useEffect`
  - `const fetchDataMemoized = React.useCallback(fetchData, [url, schema]);`

  ```typescript
  React.useEffect(() => {
    fetchDataMemoized();
  }, [fetchDataMemoized]);
  ```

- `const fetchReducer = <T,>( ...)`
  - the comma after the type generic was included by Max to force the VsCode linter to interpet the generic type as a type and NOT as a JSX tag
  - the code is functionally equivalent to just using `<T>`, but without the comma, VSCode would give errors



### Create generic loading and error components
- lets you define a custom error message or custom error message and display them


### Misc
`import Beer from "@/components/Beer"`
  - the `@` is a path alias
    - don't have to use `../../components/Beer`
  - in `vite.config.ts`
    - can define an alias for that `@` symbol
  - also need to update `tsconfig.json`

### Summary
- useReducer is best for:
  - state objects that represent processes or discrete steps or stages (fetching data)
  - state objects with interdependent properties (e.g., form fields)
  - state objects with complex fields and transitions (games, large shopping carts)

- use custom hooks:
  - to reuse state and effect logic in multiple components

  - best use cases:
    - almost any generalizable state or side effect functionality
      - anytime you have the same pattern of state and effect hooks across multiple components

    - https://usehooks.com
      - examples of custom hooks (like debounce)
      - these are very standardized




## Demo 2
- build a "cool app"
- start with standard new vite app

- have a rizz button that you can change the color
  - there is a select input
  - the value selected is stored in state as `theme`
  - `colorThemes` object defines a set of styles which are passed as an object which is passed as to a `style` prop on the button element

### Start to create a component hierarchy
- i.e,. bury things within a string of nested components to demonstrate each component
  - illustrates "prop drilling"
  - there aren't any real issues with prop drilling if it's straightforward

### Change the color of button, banner, and footer
- pass the `theme` object into the `<Header>`, `<Footer>`
  - also create a nested structure in <Header>

- still prop drilling into <Main> and <Header>
  - theme state is getting passed to multiple adjacent (sibling) components
  - it's not obvious that Header, Main, and Footer should all receive a `theme` prop
  - semantically, Header, Main, and Footer shouldn't necessarily receive theme
    - what if you add <Sidebar>?  How will anyone know it should also receive `theme`

  - prop drilling is fine until:
    - multiple adjacent components that all consume the same state value, which is getting passed through multiple levels

    - this is the use case for `useContext`
      - `useContext` passes state down to any child without using `props`
      - state still resides in the parent, but a child component that needs to access that state would do so directly
      - the parent is called the "provider"
      - the child (using state) is called the "consumer"

    - good use cases for context:
      - one-way data sharing or infrequently updated components
      - simple pieces of state (single value or object)
      - e.g., routing libraries use context, color theme, feature flags, locale specific styling



### implement useContext
- create a new folder `providers`
  - add `ThemeProvider.js`:
    - create a context object that child components will import
    - define a context-provider

  - in general it's better to not provide components with a way to directly change state
    - it makes it more likely that they will pass in things that don't make sense
    - i.e., its the same reason why we don't pass setters down through props (a design convention) that will help limit the ability of other consumers to change things in a way that might break the app 
      - i.e., similar to principles in OOP where setters/getters are not directly accessible outside of the class



  ```javascript
  import React from 'react';

  export const ThemeContext = React.createContexet();
  
  export const ThemeProvider = ({children}) => {
    const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState('default');

    const handleColorChange = (colorTheme) => setTheme(colorTheme);

    return (
      <ThemeContext.Provider value={ theme, handleColorChange}> // anything can go in this value prop (typically state and handlers to allow component to change state)
        {children}
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
  };
  ```

  - in main `App.tsx` need to wrap the entire app with <ThemeProvider>
    - should we always wrap the top level?
      - not always, but it's common - that's part of the use case of context (e.g., styling, feature flags, etc.)

  - now, need to define consumers
  - within each component that needs context:
    - need to import the `ThemeContext` (exported from `ThemeProvider.jsx`)
    - `const { theme, handleColorChange } = React.useContext(ThemeContext);`
      - this is destructuring the "value" prop that was passed into the Context
  
  - `useContext` is distinct from custom hooks since this is SHARED state
    - custom hooks would all create distinct (independent) state
  


### add console.log to every component to see render order
- things render in the order in which they are are invoked
  - if <Header> is nested, it will render all of the components in the <Header> tree

- when using context, ONLY the child components which use that context will re-render
  - components which aren't subscribed won't update


### Add voting to app
- buttons are stored deep in component tree in <Main>
- result of the votes are in <Banner>

- could store the state in <App>, but this is a good use case for context
  - store state in context since it needs to go to <Main> and <Header>

- should we create separate context for votes and themes?
  - could wrap (nest) 2 providers around the <App> component
    - this is a common production pattern

  - if theme changes based upon the result of the vote
    - this creates a dependency - hence, should have reducers to keep states


- can add useReducer code to context provider to manage state
  - good practice to create handlers for various action types
  - then those handlers can be passed via context for components to invoke specifically (no need to keep track of action type string)


- connect voting buttons to the handlers passed down via context

- note that all components that have access to the context (and it's associated state) (i.e., consumers of the provided state)
  - all of these components will be re-rendered
  - However, footer doesn't need to re-render when it has nothing to do with the votes
    - it should only re-render when it NEEDS to (i.e., the theme colour changes)
  - when the state inside the provider changes - ALL consumers will change, whether or not the specific staet value they need change
  
  - this *could* be a problem if
    - state changes frequently (the severity of this frequency will depend on the architecture of the application, performance, etc.)
    - the components being re-rendered are computationally expensive / slow (e.g., if there was a data fetch inside the footer)


### Thinking about performance
- generally, first step is thinking about context and unneeded re-renders
  - shouldn't use context if that value changes frequently
  - if state is more complex:
    - i.e., more component subscribe, or state changes more frequently
    - *don't* use context - this will definitely affect performance


## Global state management libraries
- e.g., using Redux
  - if you have global state that is related, but not all components need / should update whenever that state changes
  - designed for large production contexts
  - key difference is that consumers will only re-render when the specific part of the state used is updated


- global state vs local state
  - global state:  application data you want to keep accessible to multiple unrelated components throughout your app
  - local state:  state relevant to 1 component and it's direct children


- you won't use Redux on a take-home
  - more important to get exposure to it and understand why it's being used
