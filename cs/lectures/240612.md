## React query

### intro video and questions
 intro video: [React Query](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrliU0e09io)
  - limitations of useEffect and Context for data fetching?
    - need to manage loading and error states manually
    - need to manage request invalidation manually
    - context creates a performance issue when used across larger apps
    - typically would need to extract logic into custom hooks
      - context serves as a kind of "cache" to prevent multiple requests of the same data
    - could create race conditions, multiple fetches of the same data
      - if a user clicks multiple times, there might be multiple in-flight requests at the same time
        - there's no guarantee for when those requests will get resolved
        - can fix that with an "ignore flag" and clean-up function
    

  - what is client state?
    - app-specific state: i.e., color themes, authentication status, language settings, etc.
    - client state is defined by the user and the client is the source of truth
      - we have synchronous access to this state (it's in-memory)
        - e.g., is this menu open or closed, what page we are on, form state


  - what is server state?
    - information stored somewhere other than the client (e.g., back-end db, etc.)
    - server state source of truth is across a network (async state)
      - need to make requests over network
      - this state is shared - other clients or server can change this state
      - the data we grab on client side may be out-of-date


  - what are some challenges with server state?
    - de-duping requests
    - out-dated requests
    - caching
    - working w/ async introduces some additional challenges:
      - "useEffect hell" - manage clean-up of effect functions used to fetch data (this was the de-duping request issue) - need to setup useEffect and clean-up
    - pagination (if you have more results than you can display on 1 page, e.g., 10 results per page)
    - mutations, optimistic updates
      - if I request that data be changed on the server
      - how do I confirm if that change is actually made - assume request is successful?



  - is React Query a data fetching library?
    - No: it's an async state manager for server state
      - React Query doesn't fetch state for you
      - can use anything that returns a promise (e.g., `fetch`)

    - could have a number of different async sources
      - most dbs would be accessed only through a server (typically wouldn't make the db accessible to public)
      - you might access different API endpoints (e.g., 3rd parties) from your front end

    - actual data fetching libraries:  e.g., axios, native JS `fetch` API


### approaches
- past approaches have involved redux:
  - i.e., maintaining 2 sources of "truth" : server-state is stored as a copy in redux,


- stale-while-revalidate (swr) strategy:
  - once a request is received
  - is response cached?  (checked against a query key)
    - if not:  make request, store response in cache
    - if so: check if cache is valid
      - if valid:
        - return response and determine if cache is stale
        - if so, update cache
      - if not:
        - make request, store response in cache

  - note:  stale is a subset of invalid
    - you could invalidate cache on a number of reasons other than stale

  - the swr strategy is also applied to things like CDNs and SSG pages

### react query example
- don't focus on syntax - focus on the problems that react query solves

## Web rendering patterns
- web rendering:  when and where the app front-end is transformed from code and data to the static resources visible in the browser

- see basecamp notes

### client-side rendering (CSR)
- original react model (SPA)
- server sends HTML shell and JS
- then JS needs to be executed (even if JS is cached, it still needs to be executed)
- subsequent page transitions are made via JS

- while HTML / JS is loading, user will see ONLY blank screen loader
- there is a longer first load, but the subsequent loads will be faster
- SEO will be worse:
  - SPAs can't be crawled
  - tags within initial index.html must be very deliberate
  - historically, web crawlers didn't execute JS
    - nowadays, this is less of an issue
  - seach engines may also measure the amount of time it takes to get content back

- common use cases for this:
  - dashboards and interactive apps - snappy response after initial load is important

- this was the default rendering expectation for React up until about 5 yrs ago


### server-side rendering (SSR)
- server does the initial rendering to HTML of react code
  - the server then sends that HTML to the browser
- initial request is a white screen w/ loader
- the initial response contains HTML content
  - hence - faster time to initial view of content
- browser then needs to execute JS
  - initial HTML would be static
    - initial DOM elements are generated by server
  - interaction in the website may not available until JS is executed (depending on how site is implemented)
  - this gap is the *hydration gap*
    - the site is available, but not interactive, yet
    - hydration ALWAYS has to occur (even if JS doesn't need to be re-requested)
      - a new HTML must be rendered in the client and compared to the desired virtual DOM
        - there can be a *hydration mismatch*
      - then JS code and event listeners, etc. must be re-attached to the HTML
      - from here, react can create new DOM elements, etc. as per react code

- after JS is executed, website is available for full interaction

- subsequent page transitions can be client-side OR server-side
  - subsequent server-side pages will also have a hydration gap

- better SEO for SSR pages
- rendering happens TWICE - once in the server and once in the client

- SSR would typically NOT be used for 'hybrid' sites that use vanilla HTML/JS and react elements


### static site generation (SSG)
- all pages are pre-rendered by the server and cached
- rather than generating that page at request time, you just return the cached version (often a CDN is used)
- the client will receive these pages and will then go through the hydration process (if there is JS)
- every user will get the same page

- trade-offs
  - personalization and authentication are hard to implement
  - data changes require the page to be re-built
  - lots of pages can lead to long build times

- use cases (typically all content is the same for everyone):
  - blogs
  - news media
  - portfolios

- there may be sophisticated methods of implementing authentication and paywalls, but it's probably easier to do this through SSR
  - simplistically, SSG would not be an option for paywalls


### hybrids
- with modern frameworks, you can combine a variety of these options
  - e.g., SSG for common public pages for marketing, etc.
  - for authenticated routes:  use SSR for initial page (and then leverage CSR)

- think about things on a page-by-page basis to determine what you might need



## JS Frameworks in 2024
- some terms:
  - partial hydration
  - SSR
  - no runtime framework
  - static caching

- perspective:  the past decade of JS frameworks has been all about performance
  - the time it takes to deliver a response to the client
  - the time it takes to make that response visible in the browser
  - the time it takes to make that page interactive

### mid-2000s
- in the mid-2000s
  - from server rendering to AJAX
    - changed from traditional HTTP request-response cycle (server rendered pattern)
    - AJAX allowed client-side data fetching
      - this allowed more interactions, fewer page requests
      - easier to interact with web sites, felt faster
  - frameworks emerged for this:
    - jquery
    - angular
    - react

### early 2010s
- early 2010s :  success of React
  - React "won" because of:
    - 1-way data flow
    - view as a function of application state
    - components (logic, styling, etc. combined)
  
  - Angular is still around now, but less common

### mid 2010s
- mid 2010s:  tradeoffs of React and SPAs
  - long initial page loads (i.e., Client-side rendering)
    - large bundles, parsing / executing JS, subsequent data fetching, etc.
    - solutions involve sending less initial bundles:
      - code splitting
      - deferred script loading
  - loading spinners were common (didn't do a full page load, but need to indicate to user that data load was taking place)
    - solutions:
      - prefetching
      - global state libraries (redux, react-query)
  - SEO / indexing
    - hard to crawl

- performance-wise:
  - deliver a response to the client was okay
  - initial response was an HTML shell - not really visible
  - making the visible page interactive - so-so:  subsequent interactions were fast, but initially it was slow to load


### 2017
- starting in 2017:  move from SPAs to SSG
- Gatsby:  a react SSG that lead the way in the JS ecosystem
  - React's built-in SSG was hard to use / configure
  - Gatsby leveraged that mode and created abstractions around it to make it easier
  - Gatsby would source data-dependencies (e.g., your own db, content management site, etc. )
    - then combine sources to generate static pages
    - then cache those pages

- advantages of SSG:
  - CDN is faster
  - response is immediately visible HTML
    - react app hydrates in the background
  - smart defaults:
    - code splitting, pre-fetching, etc.
    - spinners, etc.

- trade-offs:
  - build time is proportional to size of the site
    - optimizations may reduce the rate of growth (i.e., may not be linear)
  - frequent content changes means frequent builds
    - later on, only pages that were changed needed to be re-generated, but initially, all pages needed to be re-built
  - personalization and authentication don't work well
  - hydration cost (common problem for late 2010 solutions)

- use cases (content-rich, low personalization):
  - landing pages
  - marketing pages
  - blogs
  - documentation
  - portfolios

### 2017 - 2020
- Next.js was developed around the same time as Gatsby
  - framework for React
  - included best practices out-of-the-box
  - made SSR easy to implement
  - in 2020, they added an SSG mode

- around 3 to 4 years ago
  - Gatsby vs Next.js
  - both were becoming React frameworks either SSR or SSG

- common challenge:  the cost of hydration
  1. server renders assets
  2. client receives assets and paints browser
  3. hydration gap:  JS application needs to run
      - google added performance measurements for SEO evaluation
      - this made the hydration gap even more important
  4. elements are interactive

- performance rating:
  - did great for deliver a response to client (SSG), SSR was a bit less good
  - making the response visible to the client was great
  - make the visible page interactive:  not so good (hydration cost)


- concurrent developments in web infrastructure:
  - provisioning and deployment in 1 command (made mgmt of infra much easier)
    - e.g., AWS/GCP => Netlify, Vercel, Fly.io
  - rise of serverless
    - entire APIs deployed to serverless functions
      - (each endpoint could be it's own serverless function for SSR)
    - could also be an endpoint for 1-off dynamic functions for static sites
  - rise of edge functions:
    - static assets (CDNs) and compute (serverless) which occur geographically close to users
    - reduces latency for request-response cycle
  
  - implications (bottlenecks are changing):
    - server latency is no longer the performance bottleneck
    - biggest performance bottlenecks
      - JS bundle size (larger bundle takes longer to send)
      - time to hydrate the page (also dependent on bundle size)


### Next gen of front-end
- Astro (launched around 2021)
  - key objectives:  reduce hydration cost and JS footprint for static sites (send less JS)
  - focused on SSG (for content sites), with SSR option
  - they claim "no runtime framework"
    - by default, they generate pages with no client-side JS
    - when you build the site (using whatever run-time library, e.g., preact, react, etc.)
      - Astro compiles all of it to HTML, except for necessary JS (your bundle will NOT include react or other front-end frameworks)
  - they claim "partial hydration"
    - they don't turn the entire page into CSR app
    - they only send JS for the interactive parts of the page



- Svelte
  - alternative to React
  - a front-end compiler built for performance
  - no runtime or virtual DOM: compiles to plain HTML & JS

  - why Svelte?
    - low bandwidth or low-powered devices where performance is critical
    - complex, visually-intensive applications (e.g., data viz) where removing the runtime execution of React would improve performance
    - eliminates hydration cost - just event listeners (so no need to hydrate)

  - tradeoffs?
    - harder to hire for Svelte, React is common, lots of ecosystem libraries to address challenges




- React Server Components (RSC)
  - React's official solution for server rendering
    - this is not SSR - these components are ONLY rendered on the server, they are not re-rendered on the client
    - this means:
      - can't use typical React hooks (useEffect, useState, etc.) for server components
      - server components can have direct access to server data (e.g., db, etc.) - this code doesn't execute on the client
        - no interactivity, but no data fetching
        - the use of large server-side libraries doesn't affect the client - it's not sent to the client
    - client components are rendered in typical SSR approach (hydration in client)
    - fewer components in bundle means better performance
    - server-side components are rendered to basic HTML
      - client components are rendered as "placeholders" for later hydration in client-side


### trade-offs of next gen approaches
- all solutions are recent - haven't been "battle-tested" in production at-scale
  - e.g., Astro, Remix, Qwik, etc.

- these are sensitive to deployment approach
  - e.g., deploying next requires vercel
  - deploying React server components on your own is difficult
  - Remix - encouraged to deploy ONLY to edge functions, it doesn't make sense to deploy to a long-running server

- more complicated abstractions and mental models
  - complexity can be its own cost
  - harder to maintain / fix bugs, etc.



### current debates
- where to render?  client-side vs server-side
  - Is SSR just a trend?

- what are the most effective methods to improve performance?
  - e.g., minimize JS:  Astro, Svelte
  - e.g., ditch React:  Svelte, Qwik, SolidJS
  - e.g., React Server Components (render most on the server)


### Q&A
- webpack / vite - where do they fit?
  - prior discussion was a USER discussion
  - Vite, ESBuild, etc. affect developers
    - those tools are mostly developer-experience concerns
  - a lot of frameworks are compiling at build-time not run-time - this has been a trend

- React:
  - one of the most enduring things about it is probably being able to create composable components (style, logic, state, etc. ) all combined
  - even "no-react" frameworks tend to allow components, etc.
  - it's been around for a while - battle-tested, has grown in popularity since it's pretty good
  - all of the problems we've discussed are the result of *SCALING* React apps to significant sizes
    - we probably won't see these challenges - scope / size is more smaller / simpler


- wordpress - server-side rendered PHP
  - there is now "headless" wordpress - which makes an API available
    - you can use next.js or something else to render your front-end
