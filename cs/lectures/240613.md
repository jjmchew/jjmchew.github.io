# Thu Jun 13, 2024 - W6D4 React

## Take-home project
- create a private repo (it was a previous take-home interview project)

## Routing in React
- react router
  - merged with remix and adopted the remix syntax
    - are often introducing breaking changes
    - syntax has become much more complicated
    - old syntax (i.e., from fsopen) still works

- wouter : also an option
  - much simpler
  - less features
  - good for takehomes, small production apps

- creating a router library could be a good capstone project

- should set a limited time limit - like a real take-home project
  - i.e., just Thurs and Fri
  - look at requirements and try to figure things out on your own
  - try them as if you're doing a real take-home
  - if you make major design decisions, write down your assumptions

  - don't waste hours on setting up the app (vite should be great)
  - no server, has data from a file
  - do the project in typescript
  - originally, student had to create their own HTML and CSS
    - for our project, HTML/CSS will be given (not great, but passable)


## Project demo
- goal of this project is building the project from scratch and using a library you haven't used before (router)

- app demo:
  - starting with just sidebar
  - should be able to click on Home Plans or Lots in sidebar
  - if you click on show saved homes - should show blank if nothing is saved
  - click on a home: a modal is visible
    - very important that the route changes and the background is greyed out
    - note that if you click on a lot then the route should change to lots (in the background, with an updated URL)
      - the modal content should then also change to display the selected lot
      - if you then click on a home, the modal content should update to show a home (and the background will also change to load the homes route)
  
  - non-persistent (no db)
  - don't need to implement the modal the way it was done in the sample code
    - you could change the CSS and implement modal differently



## Moving forwards
- each take-home project will have different challenges
  - e.g., use AWS, implement pagination, etc.

- we'll mostly just be working on take-home projects in the morning
  - the intent is for mornings to be a bit "lighter" so we have energy to work on capstone project in the afternoons

- tomorrow morning, will go straight to rooms
  - Srdjan will then circulate wants to see our code tomorrow in the walkarounds
  - wherever we get to is where we get to
    - he doesn't expect us to get to testing, but if you do - great
  
- Note: take-home projects for interviews can vary widely:
  - some will be stuff we've done in core:
    - e.g., tic tac toe, implement classes with inheritance, etc.
