## plan
- just worked on "homes" take-home project

## Final comments
- when we need to use an external library for a project
  - need to do research to figure out how to use that library
  - if you don't use it correctly, it will create issues
  - if you use typescript (optionally) and you do a bad job with a typescript implementation you may be penalized
  - if you use an external library, etc.
    - you can have errors - what is passable may be grey
    - BUT you should not have fundamental errors in typescript
  - people may not care about minor issues
    - e.g., rendering via state vs params is a grey area

- 90% of the time "app" state will need to be in the app or in context
  - if you put that state lower, then things generally won't work
  - form state should always stay in a form
  - if you conditional render a component, the state should go 1 level up
    - for this project, we used the search params so we didn't have to create a state 1 level up

- in routing - use of <Switch>
  - if you don't use switch, then the router will continue rendering ALL matches
  - so if you have a `*` path, then you *must* use <Switch>, otherwise content in both routes will be rendered

- don't change id's to 'false' - just leave id's as id's
