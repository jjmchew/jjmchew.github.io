## React take-home project
- see project description in basecamp:
  - https://3.basecamp.com/3695031/buckets/36641615/documents/7514836378

- must do it in TypeScript
- it's on the easier side for take-home projects
- must do everything by yourself
- you need to figure out "what's enough"
  - we should be able to implement whatever, when told
  - we need to determine when the project is "complete" - students don't know what is enough

- we have 2 days - today and tomorrow
  - we should do as much as possible
  - don't prematurely send a project that isn't your best
  - think about all of the requirements and what's possible

- do not lose hours on setting up the app for front and back
  - this can be difficult - don't spend a day doing this
  - ping Srdjan if you're having trouble with this

- write all design decisions in the readme file
  - we will have to make decisions on our own

- don't work on take-home project after morning class - strictly time given only
  - we should have 6 hours on this

## Take-home projects
- with a full-stack project
  - you need to work on both the front and the back - 2 different applications

- the back-end is concerned with developer experience
  - you want the developer experience to be efficient, resilient, etc.
  - think about how to make the developer's life easier

- the front-end
  - you're just using some API - you have some routes
  - your goal is to make the best possible user (regular user) experience
  - make things clear, look nice, be straightforward
  - user won't read documentation
  - if the user clicks something and nothing happens, messages should be displayed properly

- for full-stack - need to think about both sides

- the first project could take as much time as you want (15 - 20 hrs?)
  - it all depends on what you implement
  - first, think about how much time you have
  - consider the requirements - i.e., if there are new libraries or specific requirements
    - you may have to ramp up on new libraries / techniques (e.g., testing)
  - first implement main functionality (i.e., given requirements)
  - with leftover time:
    - think about more tests (should I add more tests?)
    - make the app look nicer?
    - make the app more resilient to errors?
    - implement bonus features?  (none in this given app)
  - generally, won't have time for everything
    - everything else goes into the README.md
      - e.g., add more tests, nicer UI, etc.
  
  - also think about what's "good enough" that you want to submit it
    - think about the competition
    - your app might not be the best (likely they'll interview a few people)
    - think about what can make your app stand-out?
      - e.g., nicer UI, more tests, etc.
      - lean on your strengths
    - a full-stack app should look nice
    - the app should WORK efficiently


- app should be "production-ready"
  - include tests
  - include appropriate file structure
  - even with a very small app, split it into different folders (routes, services, etc.)
    - demonstrate convention of building express apps (i.e., so that the app can grow naturally)
    - e.g., if you have routes folder, services folder, etc.
  - clean code!  easy to read is critical for take-home projects
  - add error handling!
  - if you have time - make the back-end app more efficient
  - comment if the code isn't self-explanatory
    - shouldn't need to explain things that should be straightforward

- some take homes may ask for documentation
  - was rare
  - could use jsdoc for API documentation


- recommend creating boilerplate client and server express/typescript testing setup
  - this will make starting a take home MUCH faster
  - setting up testing can be tricky sometimes
