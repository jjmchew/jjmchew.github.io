# Tues June 18, 2024 - W7D2

## React
- continue working on the fullstack 1 project

### Demo of student solution to fullstack #1
- the student met the requirements and had an interview
- UI
  - had some styling - "pleasant"
  - had a background, go, reset buttons
  - our project should not look worse than some styled colour, etc.
  - SHOULD spend some time on CSS
    - don't need to do anything crazy

- input
  - had some validation
  - putting in 10,000,000 - very fast
  - up to 100,000,000 - not bad
  - shouldn't crash the server for 10bn
  - would like to see a spinner while receiving the data
    - the UI should show something while the app is loading
  - should have indicated the limits for entering a number (e.g., 2 to 100 million)
    - then could run validation on that
  - server shouldn't crash and handle errors gracefully

- back-end
  - need to have a reasonable algorithm for getting primes (up to at least 10 million)
  - need to be able to defend the code that we implement

- looking at the code (back):
  - index.js file : smaller wrapper, routes in a separate folder/file
    - this is a good thing
  - they have a separate function for everything
    - e.g., isValidNumber
    - e.g., sieve(number)
  - using a parameter or a query string - it's up to you
    - BUT:  should NOT use a POST request
    - should use a GET request - we're GETTING a result (we're not making a post request)
  - have tests for isValidNumber
    - just need 2 tests:  1 valid, 1 invalid
  - for routes:
    - use supertest:
      - just 2 tests:  1 valid, 1 invalid should be enough
  - should test every module: a valid and invalid test

- front-end code:
  - used create react app
  - app component: 2 states 
    - numResult and isShowingResults

  - had a number form with some handlers
  - tests were very simple
    - if the spin button existed
    - tests to contain heading
    - test to contain image
    - mocking a response from the server is a good approach for testing as well!
  - App didn't have anything to test, hence no test file for App
    - they passed the setter down and thus there was no need to test the App component
    - if you do pass the setter, then you don't need to test App
    - if you don't pass the setter down and create handlers in the App component, then you should test the App component

  - front-end SHOULD be split into different components
    - better to demonstrate that we CAN split things into components, than write in a readme file why we didn't split the components

- readme file
  - would cap the input
  - would add a cache later



- need to think about 2 apps: front and back
  - front:  clear UI, clear messages, definitely loading indicator
  - back: app should not crash with high number
    - can pre-compute numbers and cache them on the back-end (not required)
