# Wednesday June 19, 2024 - W7D3

## Next 3 days
- working on a full stack project and a live interview project
- it's enough for 90% of folks (likely that you won't finish everything)

- full stack project:
  - given boilerplate code - need to debug
  - need to write tests
  - need to implement pagination

  - read the readme file
  - don't skip challenges - there may be some spoilers (defeats the purpose of the exercise)
  - need to test with jest
  - implement pagination

  - a js project
  - may need to downgrade node to 16.x (this is an older project)
  - no time limit
  - when you finish all challenges, we'll get a live interview challenge
