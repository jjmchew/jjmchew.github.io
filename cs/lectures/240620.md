## worked on React project
- worked on testing and pagination

## Discussion of project
- if you are uncomfortable with mocking, practice mocking with the crypto app
  - the more you practice, the easier it should get
  - jest and vite should be very similar and easy to understand

- pagination:
  - we didn't discuss how it should be done (we'll talk about that next week)
    - frequently, you'll have to implement something you aren't comfortable with
    - hence, you should DO RESEARCH to figure out best practices
      - e.g., check front-end AND back-end
      - for front-end:  since we were given code which used Material UI, we should have used Material UI
      - for back-end:  much more difficult
  
  - back-end:
    - could only paginate users - not bad, but passable
      - could use parameters (e.g., path:  /user/pageNum/rowsPerPage)
        - this is harder for the developer, easy to forget which is pageNum and which is rowsPerPage
        - hence, better to use query params - it's easier for the developer
    - you could also "filter" applications and payments - it's better
    
  - generally, for back-ends, it's always better to include capability for pagination
    - otherwise, you cannot get performance improvements
    - if you send the "links" property, it will tell you what the next, prev, first, last pages are and use those link properties to set the links on the front end

## Project management lecture
- why is project management important?
  - people should agree on what they work on and in what order
  - companies will assume people will be familiar with some form of project management
    - note that approaches will vary by company

    - the approach introduced here is generally common

  - developing a project without a plan can make it messier

- use a milestone-based approach to building software
  - work on the most important parts first
  - it's helpful to see things working before we decide what to work on next
    - may make optimizations later

- 2 common pitfalls to projects:
  - "how to draw an owl": in 2 steps
    - first some circles
    - then the finished owl
    
    - don't assume that the prototype includes all of the features of the final
  
  - building stuff that isn't functional
    - e.g., build a car by starting with the tires, then adding a chassis, then adding a body, then adding steering wheel, etc.
    - if the pieces you build aren't functional, then you won't really know if what you build is useful

    - at each stage, you have something useful and you can assess if something is useful
    - if you find that the more basic version (like a bike) works, then you don't need to build a car

  - milestone 1:
    - the simplest version of something that you can actually test
      - no styling
      - no efficiency or optimization
      - no persistence
      - not easy to use
      - maybe not even the preferred or proposed architecture
      - no automation

    - can allow you to verify that things work and then think about optimizations, additions, etc.

  - milestone 2:
    - based on the limitations of milestone 1, iterate to the next usable version
    - it might still be clunky and limited, but it solves the central problem and someone could theoretically use it
    - this should solve the use case that we propose
    - may not be pleasureable to use (e.g., a bike)
  
  - milestone 3:
    - based on those limitations, build next iteration that:
      - solves most of the usability problems
      - makes the application enjoyable
    - it may not satisfy every use case, or may find that you satisfy a particular use case better than expected
    - from there, plan to polish and add features

  - this is called the *testable/usable/enjoyable* milestones
    - i.e., earliest testable
    - then earliest usable
    - then earliest enjoyable


### Max's capstone project
- Bento: a serverless video transcoding pipeline
  - video files are large, so it's hard to change them from 1 format to another
  - use the concurrecy of lambda functions to split up the video file into many parts
    - transcode in parallel
    - then stitch those parts back together

- project milestones:
  - testable stage:
    - upload and transcode 1 video file using a single lambda function
    - no concurrency, no UI
    - lambdas have a storage limit (can't transcode large video files)
    
    - didn't meet the use case, but served as proof-of-concept

  - usable stage:
    - core use case:  split video file, transcode the pieces in parallel and put them back together
    - no ui
    - still had the 500 mb limit (only short video files)

    - this meets core use case of project
    - clunky, but functional (solved engineering challenges)
      - still had 2 weeks left
    
  - enjoyable stage:
    - add a UI and backend (CRUD)
    - no strict file size limit
      - stream some of file to the lambda and when finished, stream the rest to S3
    
    - fulfilled the use case and improved on the experience


### Rough schedule
- week 9:  testable
- week 10 - 11: usable
- week 11+: enjoyable


### Team exercise
- for our project, define each stage:
  - earliest testable
  - earliest usable
  - earliest enjoyable

  - see whimsical for notes for our group

## Project management processes
- there are a few common approaches to be familiar with
  - waterfall
  - agile
  - scrum
  - kanban

- waterfall:
  - traditional approach
  - each phase of the project happens sequentially
  - start with analysis
    - then design
      - then implement
        - then test
          - then maintenance
  - generally not a popular approach these days
  - easy to understand
  - doesn't accommodate changes once you move to the next stage
    - the process doesn't allow for changes to happen much
  - generally used by large companies

- agile:
  - more common these days
  - iterative approach to development
  - focuses on collaboration, feedback, small rapid releases
  - each iteration is called a sprint to develop a working piece of the software
  - sprints tend to be 2 - 4 weeks long
    - very dependent on the company
    - some companies do 1 week sprints
  - in each sprint, move through all of the waterfall phases at the same time
    - will plan, implement, review, ship whatever you've been working on during that sprint
  - based on the feedback after shipping (could be internal or external feedback) you would plan for the next iteration
  - for us, we might be providing our own feedback

  - promotes adaptability
    - changes and improvements can happen at each stage
  
  - there are different agile methodologies

- scrum:
  - a subset of agile
  - provides a fixed framework for dealing with changes and making sure people are shipping and getting feedback
  - there are more roles in scrum:
    - product owner (represents stakeholders)
    - scrum master (make sure daily meetings run smoothly)
  - start with a product backlog, then plan
    - create a sprint backlog
    - daily scrum (everyone working on the project, stakeholders, etc.) all review progress and talk about what they're working on
    - finish work, sprint review
  
  - the daily stand-up is the most enduring part of this process
  - can think of it as agile with additional management roles

- kanban
  - another framework for agile
  - visualizes the entire project on a board
  - allows people to see the entire project on the board at 1 time
  - can move things from ready to next, etc.


- parts that we can use:
  - we might work on 1 week sprints in an agile-like way
  - we might use a visual board (like a kanban board)
  - we might have a daily scrum to review progress on each task and move them forward on the board


## Demo of kanban board on trello
- can go to trello
- can create a new board
- make columns:
  - backlog (everything you can think of)
  - up next (tasks for the current milestone)
  - in progress (stuff people are currently working on)
  - testing / stalled (can't make progress on it for some reason)
  - done

### for bento project
- backlog (brainstorm all of the work we might need to do):
  - build a lambda that transcodes one video
  - build a lambda that splits a video
  - build a lambda that merges pieces of a video
  - figure out what db to use in aws
  - build a dashboard
  - research how to bypass 500 mb bottleneck

- then tag each task and add a label
  - e.g., milestone1, milestone2, etc.
  - then tag each task with the labels

- then pull the tasks related to the current milestone
  - people can pick tasks to work on whatever they're using

- move cards based on what category it fits into


## Roles within the team
- how to assign roles to people within the team
- clarifying roles within a team (i.e., who is responsible for decision-making and for doing what is helpful)

### role example
- architecture diagram with manager platform (w/ UI, backend and db), NATS message broker, sdk service, user applications (have an embedded SDK)
- could split each part of the architecture to different people
  - e.g., 1 person UI
  - 1 person SDK
  - 1 person SDK service
  - 1 person backend/db

  - an owner would be accountable for making sure the technical implementation gets done for all of the work
  - doesn't mean that no one else can work on it
  - 1 person should know exactly what is going on with a particular part of the architecture
    - it's helpful to have someone as a lead over different parts
  - being an owner is just ultimately accountable for completing it and you know the status
    - responsible for testing, security, error handling, etc.

- recommend assigning a project manager
  - determine what features are part of each milestone
  - prioritizing tasks
  - they might not make these decisions in isolation - they would still get input from the team
    - in most cases group consensus is sufficient for moving forwards
    - if there's heavy debate, or "coin flip" decisions, a PM can make a call
  - PMs are responsible for clarity:
    - what are we doing?
    - when should it be done by?
    - keep people accountable
    - manage kanban board
  
  - for a project this size, the PM might take on some extra work
    - this is a bit of extra work, but should lead to less work overall

- recommendations:
  - have each person "own" some part of the architecture or feature
    - scope doesn't need to be equal
  - assign a project manager so that things are moving smoothly from milestone to milestone
  - project mentor will help you / project manager validate decisions

  - the roles are all about clarity and info sharing
    - focus on communicating "what is the state of this area"
    - intended to keep things from getting dropped or missed


## Writing good project tasks:
- context:  what needs to be done?  Why?
- references:  material to help the owner complete the tasks (e.g., screenshots, code snippets, slack threads, links to research)
- priority:  what is the associated milestone
- related tags:  tag with area, link to related tasks or sub tasks
