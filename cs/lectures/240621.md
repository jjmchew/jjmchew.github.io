# Fri Jun 21, 2024 - W7D5

## Morning
- work on react projects
- today is a buffet:
  - continue working on debugging app (implement pagination)
  - work on react live project (https://3.basecamp.com/3695031/buckets/36641615/documents/7528115365)
  - optional trello exercises (https://3.basecamp.com/3695031/buckets/36641615/documents/7532289467)
  - work on anything that's been covered in the past weeks
  - work on project ideation (we'll get a project mentor on monday)

- next week will be busy
  - there won't be "free time" next week

## Next week
- homework is split between Mon / Tues / Wed
  - make sure we setup an AWS account before Tues

- next week will be busy - a few different projects
  - we should focus, it should help with the job hunt
  - next week will be modified or actual take-homes or interview questions


## Project management session

### collaboration approaches / working as a team
- different types of collaboration will have different tradeoffs
- how you work on your project as a team will definitely come up in interviews
  - companies want to know that you know how to work as a team

#### pair programming
- usually 2 people looking at the same coding environment
  - usually 1 driver, 1 (or more) navigator

- driver: concerned with actual code
  - typing, etc.

- navigator: think more strategically, what direction are things happening
  - look for errors, bugs
  - look up resources
  - provide feedback, questions

- #### Spectrum
- solo programming:  more communication required, more simultaneous work threads
  - there is typically "information drift"
  - need to deliberately "sync up"
  - it's easier when you don't have to schedule


- pair programming
  - in the middle


- mob programming:  less communication required, fewer simultaneous work threads
  - typically don't need to work on communicating (everyone's there)
  - code may be high quality, but it's slow
  - great for multiple perspectives on problems
  - can be good for debugging
  - typically pretty slow, may not be very efficient
    - it can be easy to hide behind other people (i.e., just being a navigator the whole time)
  - it can be easy to burnout or get tired if others are energized - need to build in breaks
  - isn't necessary for simple tasks (e.g., like setup)


#### Tips
- have a plan
- make sure everyone codes
- build in breaks
  - it's easier than you think to get tired
  - if you're not coding, it's easy to drift

- frequently rotate roles
  - drive at least once per day

- what does your driver want?
  - some drivers like navigators to be more specific with code
  - some drivers like less direction

- switch it up

- be kind.  listen to each other



#### How to pick?
- consider:
  - team preferences
  - project characteristics
  - progress in your project

- you could alternate styles based upon stage of project
  - e.g., solo spikes
  - try all methods to determine what you like

- Max:
  - the Gatsby team would do a mob session once a week
    - it ended up being great for cameraderie / cohesion - a great way to get to know people and build cohesion and work on things together




### Github
- think about how an interviewer might look at your project
  - often they'll look at the diagrams of the case study (people look at this the most, often they don't read the whole case study)
  - they look at your github repo - they might look at commit history
    - people will rarely try to clone and run the project
    - looking at the commit history helps people understand how the project evolved

- Create a new organization (free works great)
  - pick an organization name
  - pick a contact email

- Setup coauthoring - can be good for collaboration and demonstrating that people were all working equally
  - think of optics of commits - it demonstrates who was working on the project

  - when adding a commit, add 2 spaces then:
    - "Co-authored-by: Max Hawkins<maximuskwame@gmail.com>"
    - could also look for a vscode extension "Git Mob" to make things easier

#### Git Flow
- works better when you don't have CI/CD

- main goes to develop, which goes to feature branches which go back to develop and then go to release for QA/Testing
  - from release it goes back to main (for major releases, e.g., 2.0)
- main may go to "hotfix" and back for minor releases (e.g., 2.1)

- develop branch should remain current for people to branch off for features

#### Github Flow
- just main & feature branches
  - better for smaller, less-structured process, less teams
  - typically more frequent release to main

#### Commit messages
- commit messages are a form of documentation so people can understand how the project has evolved
  - this is important for the job hunt
  - it's a good form of communication - keeps people on the same page
  - it helps debugging
    - provides clues to look for specific changes
  - it's good for code review
    - can provide context and reasoning for changes made

- generally, talk about WHAT changed and WHY
  - the code change will be the HOW

- examples:
  - BAD:  "fix",  Good:  "fix typo in user login validation"
  - bad: "user search feature",  Good:  "implement pagination feature for user search"
  - bad: update code";  good:  "refactor database query for better performance"

- e.g., conventional commits:
  - a commit specification
  - https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJqUWvmf4gg

#### Pull Requests
- add reviewers
- write a description of the changes
  - use this to guide the reviewer
  - point out sections of the code that are critical
  - point out what files might be critical
  - use this for context
  - could include instructions on how to test it
    - e.g., to test this branch, do this
    - make it easy to digest for the reviewer
  - can add screenshots
  - err on the side of being more verbose
  - we can add our own comments to the PR - it's good for demonstrating communication for the job hunt
- have team members review, comment, suggest improvements, etc.
- LGTM (looks good to me)
- we should see if the approval is given (a checkmark beside the reviewer)
- leave comments so that others can see you're being thoughtful

- after review, merge and then delete branch

- keep PRs small
  - otherwise, there will be too many code changes
  - break down the problem into smaller units (i.e., the tasks on your board are small)
    - 1 task should be 1 branch and then 1 PR
    - always best to write something for reviewer

- if PRs are open, you can keep making changes to the branch, the PR will update


- contributing to PRs
  - typically in companies, if you see something that needs to be done (e.g., adding some tests) you can typically just do it - is typically acceptable
  - for open-source projects, check contributing policies, typically projects will have formal maintainers

- good PRs:
  - descriptive
  - lots of commit messages
  - lots of discussion
  - here's how to test - with screenshots

- bad PRs:
  - no description
  - non-descriptive title
  - no reviewer
  - merged it himself
  - no conversation - doesn't add anything to the project
