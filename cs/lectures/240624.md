# Promises
- Promise.race:
  - settles as soon as any 1 of the given promises resolves or rejects

- Promise.all:
  - resolves to an array of corresponding resolved values
  - if any promise rejects, it immediately rejects all

- Promise.allSettled:
  - can resolve or reject
  - will wait for all to settle, whether they resolve or reject


## In-class exercises
- work on implementing in JS functions that mimic the functionality of:
  - Promise.race
  - Promise.all

### Race solution
```javascript
const race = (promises) => {
  return new Promise((res, rej) => {
    promises.forEach(promise => {
      promise.then(val => res(val), err => rej(err));
    })
  })
}
```
- need to run each promise
  - think of this as all promises start ticking in the background
  - whenever a promise finishes, then immediately the race function will resolve with some value that you define (coul d be the value of the provided promise)
  - when that promise resolves, we resolve the overall returned promise

- promises can't be "cancelled" natively
  - would need to use an abort controller or something else to cancel the promises in the background

- can't use async/await
  - b/c await is blocking, you can't concurrently kick off all promises
  - in a forEach loop, async/await does nothing


### All solution
```javascript
const all = async (promises) => {
  return new Promise((res, rej) => {

    let result = new Array(promises.length);
    let count = 0;

    promises.forEach((promise, idx) => {
      promise.then(val => {
        result[idx] = val;

        count += 1
        if (count === promises.length) res(result)
      }, err => rej(err));
    });
  });
}
```

### After the session
- if we didn't solve this, we should take time later to implement this without looking at the solution


## Run as quickly as possible solution

```javascript
function runPromises(arrayOfFunctions, maxLength) {
  return new Promise(res => {
    const queue = [...arrayOfFunctions];
    let finished = 0;
    const cb = () => {
      finished += 1;
      if (queue.length) {
        const fn = queue.shift();
        fn().then(cb);
      } else {
        if (finished === arrayOfFunctions.length) {
          res();
        }
      }
    };
    queue.splice(0, maxLength).forEach(fn => fn().then(cb));
  });
}
```
- first the queue is created, which will contain maxLength promises
- as soon as a promise resolves and the callback ('cb') is called
  - since there is something left in the queue, then it is added to the queue
  - then, need to check if the number of promises finished is equal to the number initially given
- because we're not keeping track of the results (i.e., order doesn't matter) we can just keep running the callback and then running the next available promise


### Alternate solution
```javascript
const runPromises = async (funcs, limit) => {
  let runningFuncs = [];
  for (let idx = 0; idx < limit && idx < funcs.length; idx += 1) { // && deals with the case if there are less than limit promises given
    runningFuncs[idx] = funcs[idx]().then(() => idx); // resolve promises to their index #
  }
  for (let nextIdx = limit; nextIdx < funcs.length; nextIdx += 1) {
    let replaceIdx = await Promise.race(runningFuncs);
    runningFuncs[replaceIdx] = funcs[nextIdx]().then(() => replaceIdx);
    // runningFuncs.push(funcs[nextIdx]()) // can't do this, since Promise.race immediately resolves all other promises that didn't resolve after the initial
  }
  await Promise.allSettled(runningFuncs);
};
```
