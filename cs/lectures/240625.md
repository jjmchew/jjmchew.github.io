## APIs
- REST vs SOAP vs graphQL vs gRPC
- need to be familiar with these things, but don't need to know how to implement
- may need to discuss this in interviews, etc.
  - companies may use this

- APIs:
  - application programming interfaces
  - an exposed interface for developers to use a service, typically these are called endpoints
  - API generally refers to a REST API since it's so common

- generally, an end-user will use an "app" (a user interface)
  - that user interface will send queries and receive a response from an API

- public apis vs private apis
  - public:  intended for consumption outside of an organization
      - may be paid or free
  - private:  only for internal use

- monoliths and microservices use APIs in different ways
  - monoliths use APIs only for extenal integration
  - microservices rely on APIs for inter-app AND external communication

### SOAP
- Simple Object Access Protocol
- more prevalent in enterprise setting
  - was used more in large enterprise apps, more typical in banking companies
  - very unlikely these days
- RPC (remote procedure calls):  invoking a function on a different machine
- has been around since 1998
- communication happens using XML
  - a bit of an issue:  XML is quite verbose - files are large
  - for mobile applications this was not ideal
- operates with 2 basic functions:  GET and POST
  - GET is used to retrieve data from the server
  - POST is used to add or modify data
- also generally uses HTTP, but doesn't need to



### REST
- representational state transfer
- a web standards based architecture using HTTP protocol for data communication
- every component is a resource which is accessing using common interface using HTTP standard methods
- could transfer data using XML, HTML, etc.
  - most common is JSON

- HTTP request:
  - method, host, path
  - headers
  - space
  - body

- REST APIs are stateless (don't keep info about state of request)
- can be operated under limited resources and low network bandwidth

- 6 constraints of a RESTful API:
  - uniform interface
  - client-server
  - stateless
  - cacheable
  - layered system
  - code on demand (optional)

- REST API rules are well-enforced - the developer needs to enforce these rules for themselves
  - there are a lot of bad APIs out there


#### Uniform interface
- each resource made available to clients must have only 1 logical URI and provide a way to get additional data
  - HATEOAS:  Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State
    - the response contains data AND also links to the action that the client can execute in order to take some action on the resource
    - this is a "best practice"
  - https://htmx.org/essays/hateoas

  - e.g., 
  ```javascript
  //... other properties from API response
  "currency": "USD",
  "links": [
    {
      "rel": "self",  // rel is the relationship between the API and another resource
      "href": "/api/v1/accounts/789" // link to the property
    },

  // ...other links for different resources, e.g., "withdraw", "deposit", etc.
  ]
  ```

#### Other constraints
- responsibilities are separated between client and server - supports scalability
- stateless:
  - each request contains all info necessary for server to process request
  - no session data is stored by server
  - each request is stand-alone
  - makes it easier to scale
  - client can still include session-info, but not required by default
- cacheable:
  - this is good (but not possible in graphQL)
- layered:
  - there can be load balancers, caching systems, firewalls, etc.
  - client doesn't need to know about these intermediaries
    - the client just tries to communicate with the server
- code on demand (optional)
  - means in response, the server can also send executable code (e.g., js code)
  - Srdjan hasn't seen this in the wild


#### REST vs SOAP
- SOAP:  very verbose
  - looks a bit like HTML
  - the equivalent request in JSON is MUCH shorter (i.e., SOAP might be 12 lines, REST might be 1 line)
  - SOAP only supports XML
  - SOAP-based reads can't be cached
    - RPC calls involve dynamic calls
    - dynamic calls are less cacheable since it changes all the time
    - banking also relies on up-to-date info, so caching is less relevant
  - uses SOAP fault messages:
    - XML: uses fault code, fault factor, etc.


- REST: more flexible
  - can support XML, HTML, JSON
  - reads can be cached
  - uses status codes to indicate success / error (e.g., 4xx, 5xx)


### graphQL
- rising in popularity, especially in support of front-end frameworks
- a query language developed by facebook initially
- schema-driven
  - need to create a schema of available data
  - gives precise data-fetching (allows the front-end to define what is required)


- why graphQL?
  - to prevent underfetching (getting less data than what you need) or overfetching (getting more information than you need)
  - REST: you may need to version APIs
    - you may have n+1 API calls - i.e., need additional calls to retrieve desired data
  - data is defined on the client-side (vs REST where data is defined on server-side)



- issues with graphQL?
  - can't cache data - users pick what they want so it's hard to cache
  - complex (especially for simple APIs)
  - graphQL always returns status code 200 - which can complicate error reporting and API monitoring
    - how do you solve this?
      - could send error messages along with responses (i.e, an error field)
  - how might you handle the case where a request asks for sensitive data?
    - implement authentication (who are you) and authorization (what do you have permission to access)
  - how would you handle a case where a ton of data needs to be sent in response to a query?
    - pagination (on the back-end) to send data in "chunks"






### gRPC
- google Remote Procedure Calls
- created by Google to speed up transmission b/w microservices and other systems that need to interact with each other
- allows developers to integrate services programmed in different languages
- transfers data in binary format
- uses HTTP/2 (faster, multiplexing, etc.)
  - browsers generally don't support gRPC
  - hence, can't be used for client-server applications

- differences to REST:
  - uses HTTP/2 instead of HTTP/1.1
  - uses protobuf instead of JSON
  - has in-born code generation (from creating and reading .proto file)
    - this code handles serialization of messages
    - supports a variety of languages - most languages are supported
    - doesn't support PHP very well
  - 7 to 10 times faster message transmission (using binary format)
  - more difficult implementation than REST
    - can be difficult to debug (since it uses a binary format)

- great for multi-language services interactions

- in JS:  uses "arrayBuffer" (a method type on fetch API responses) to receive messages

- have only seen 1 or 2 gRPC takehomes in a few years
  - can ping Srdjan if you need to know about gRPC
  - book:  'gRPC up and running' a few chapterse will be helpful
