## Designing APIs
- why care about designing APIs?
  - for developers - make their experience pleasant
    - it's an interface like any other interface
- endpoints should make sense
- make things intuitive

- best practice
  - accept and respond with JSON
  - use nouns (plural) instead of verbs in endpoint paths
    - i.e., `/articles` not `/getArticles`
    - nouns without plural (e.g., `/cart`) can remain singular
  - group endpoints for associated information
    - e.g., from Trello app:
      - boards have lists which have cards which has comments
      - i.e., `/boards/:boardId/lists/:listId`
      - nesting up to 2 deep is probably the most you should do
      - cards nested within is too deep
        - create `/cards/:cardId` (no nesting)
        - can nest comments within cards (since comments belong to cards)



  - difference between PUT and PATCH
    - PUT: idempotent
      - if the same request is sent multiple times you should still get the same outcome
        - e.g., send the updated amount in a bank balance (e.g., $10)
      - updates the whole resource (if the whole resource is sent)
        - i.e., send the entire object with the desired final value


    - PATCH: not idempotent
      - e.g., send the change in the amount (e.g., +$10)
      - if you only send 1 part of the record, then using PATCH is better
      - depending on when the request is received (in what order it's processed) you might get a different result (race conditions)
        - or if multiple requests are mistakenly sent and received, then the final value will vary


- status code: 429 too many requests

- error handling:
  - status code is not enough
  - should also provide an explicit error message in the response body
  - fail gracefully by sending an error with information to help users make corrective actions



- API should provide options for filtering through search query parameters
  - allows less information to be returned and improve user experience
  - e.g., `GET /articles?author=JohnDoe`




- should also provide opportunity for sorting
  - e.g., `http://example.com/articles?sort=author,-datepublished`
    - note:  can use `-` or `+` (escaped) to indicate descending or ascending, respectively



- also better to provide pagination on the back-end
  - typically done with query params:  limit and offset
  - e.g., `GET /api/items?limit=10&offset=20`
  - also a good idea to send total number of items so that the front-end can use that information
  - sending links to other pages (i.e., next / prev, etc.) is also good practice



### Security practices
- API key
  - this is an option if the data you are presenting is non-sensitive
  - a unique value generated for use by an API client
  - primarily a way of filtering requests by client
  - allowing requests to reset the API key is important as keys may be compromised

- OAuth2
  - allows you to use 3rd party services for authentication
  - if you don't have an access token it redirects you to a login page, then you provide that authorization
  - once you login, then the access token is passed back to the server being accessed
    - a refresh token may also be provided (typically has a longer time-to-expire)


- JWT tokens are the most common for capstone projects
  - Srdjan hasn't seen OAuth being used in capstone projects before
  - would do it for specific needs to authenticate or use resources related to 3rd parties

- JWT
  - 3 parts:
    - header, payload, signature (created by hashing header and payload)
  - steps:
    - user sends username & password
    - JWT access_token is sent back
    - future requests to server require "Authorization: Bearer <JWT>" header
    - then if token is valid requested resources can be sent back

  - for JS/Express:  can use library jsonwebtoken



### Semantic Versioning
- e.g., 21.4.4
- major.minor.fix
  - Breaking.Feature.Fix
- major incrementing:  includes breaking changes (not backwards compatible)
- minor incrementing:  safe to update, new features
- fix incrementing:  safe to update, bug fixes


- 2.5.8 : use 2.5.8
- ^2.5.8 : update to latest minor version
            - i.e., 2.*.*
- ~2.5.8 : update only fix version
            - i.e., 2.5.*

- in npm:  lock file is created which contains the specific versions which are installed
  - if you do npm update, then the versions get updated
  - if you delete the lock file, then the carat, tilde become mroe relevant



### Versioning APIs
- common methods:
  - change path:  e.g., `api/entities` vs `api/v1/entities`
    - most common, easy to add on the backend

  - query params:  e.g., `/entities?version=1`
    - caching is sometimes implemented by path, so caching may be more difficult


  - custom header:  e.g., `X-API-Version: 1`
  - content negotiation via accept header:
    - `Accept: application/vnd.mydomain.v1+json`
  
    - these last 2 options put a lot of work on the front-end

  
- versioning makes it much easier to make updates
  - it's a good practice, easy to do
  - recommended for capstone projects



### Documentation
- OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is a popular REST API description format
  - recommendation is to write in YAML format
  - could also use swagger editor or OpenAPI extension for Visual Studio Code

- use JSDoc is for documenting the internal code, different than documenting API
  - annotates route handlers, etc.
  - chatgpt is pretty good at creating docs from code

- for Capstone Project: we should document API if we have an external API


### Testing
- basic positive tests (happy paths)
- extended positive testing with optional parameters
- negative testing with a valid input (username success)
- negative testing with invalid input (username invalid)
- destructive testing (e.g., huge payload body to overflow the system)


- even if not indicated, testing is much more important
  - generally, should have at least a positive and a negative case (invalid input, something breaks)

- production-ready apps should be tested


### Rate Limiting
- limit network traffic
  - put a limit on how often someone can repeat an action within a certain timeframe

- common ways to implement:
  - fixed window
  - sliding log
  - sliding window (best of those listed)

  - there are other ways

- fixed window:
  - split the timeframe into fixed time windows (e.g., 1 min)
  - e.g., 40 requests / hour
  - split time into 1 hr windows (e.g., 10am - 11am, etc.)
  - for each hour, allow only 40 requests

  - pro:  easy
  - con:  can still have a burst of traffic - they may submit all requests in the last minute of an hour or all requests in the first minute of next hourr
    - traffic burst can still occur on window transition




- sliding log:
  - each request is logged with a timestamp
  - within the last hour, check how many previous requests were received

  - pro:  handles burst traffic the best
  - con:  you need to keep track of timestamps
    - if you have a lot of requests/users you have to keep track of info:  requires more resources to implement (need to store info in memory)




- sliding window
  - take proportion of old window (round up) and *all* requests in new window
    - proportion is calculated as remaining proportion of time elapsed in the current window


  - pro: limits burst traffic more than fixed window
    - takes less memory than sliding log
    - only needs 2 numbers (previous window count, current window count)

  
  - con: knowing how many requests are in the past window is the tricky part
    - need to keep track of various windows
    - need 2 variables:  previous window requests and current window requests


- rate limiting is previously implemented as middleware before processing routes

- rate limiting was previously a live interview question



### Solution (sliding window)
- not ideal, but okay

- need to track time and buckets
  - buckets:  can take # of secs / 60
  - can track the previous bucket as bucket - 1

```javascript
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from "express";
import { createClient, RedisClientType } from "redis";

const client: RedisClientType<any> = createClient();
client.on("error", (err) => console.error("Redis Client Error", err));
client.connect().catch(console.error);

const MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MIN: number = 10;
const RATE_LIMITER_KEY_PREFIX = "rate_limiter:";
const TTL_SECONDS: number = 120;

const getPreviousBucketRequests = async (
  currentBucket: number,
  remaining: number
): Promise<number> => {
  const previousBucket: number = currentBucket - 1;
  const counter: string | null = await client.get(
    `${RATE_LIMITER_KEY_PREFIX}${previousBucket}`
  );

  return counter ? Math.ceil(parseInt(counter) * remaining) : 0;
};

const rateLimiter = async (
  _: Request,
  res: Response,
  next: NextFunction
): Promise<void> => {
  try {
    const time: number = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
    const bucket: number = Math.floor(time / 60);
    const bucketKey: string = `${RATE_LIMITER_KEY_PREFIX}${bucket}`;

    const currentBucketRequestsString: string | null = await client.get(
      bucketKey
    );
    const currentBucketRequests: number = currentBucketRequestsString
      ? parseInt(currentBucketRequestsString)
      : 0;
    const fractionOfLastBucketInWindow: number = 1 - (time % 60) / 60;

    const previousBucketRequests: number = await getPreviousBucketRequests(
      bucket,
      fractionOfLastBucketInWindow
    );

    if (currentBucketRequests === 0) {
      await client.expire(bucketKey, TTL_SECONDS);
    }

    if (
      currentBucketRequests + previousBucketRequests >=
      MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MIN
    ) {
      res.status(429).json({ error: "Too many requests!" });
    } else {
      await client.incr(bucketKey);
      next();
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal Server Error" });
  }
};

export default rateLimiter;
```
