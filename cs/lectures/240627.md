## API challenge
- implement a NumDialer in JS
  - dial down a list of phone numbers
  - an API was provided as a fake "number dialer"


### Discussion on client-server communication
- key challenge today was to do research to determine the right approach for this
- most students know about polling and websockets

- in this project, ONLY the server needs to communicate
  - polling is NOT the best - the client needs to "nag"
  - websockets is 2nd best option:
    - there is a bi-directional option, but it isn't necessary
  - server sent events (SSE) is the BEST option
    - server can push info 1 way when it has that info

  - both SSE and websockets could have been "passable"
    - polling is NOT passable

- *how* do you figure that out?
  - always think about what is the best design decision, whether or not you know how to implement it
  - could use google or chatgpt
    - use *all* available resources
  - chatgpt
    - need to provide a clear prompt:
      - I have a project where I need to send information from server to client in 1 way communication.  I know about websockets and polling, are there other options?
  - then, follow-up on those options
  - then pick the best option
