# Tues Jul 3, 2024 - meeting w/ Chris

- discussions are great
- a paper just came out - that said vector databases won't be necessary
  - people are trying to figure out whether or not vector dbs are required
  - this is how best practices are made in real-time
  - "best" is always context dependent

- section 10 of MS course
  - power platform, low code solutions
  - are these related to what we're doing
  - any benefit to learning about this?
  - just skim through this
  - power platform is a microsoft product - it's an ad for MS
  - you need to think through the marketing hype from different companies

- function calling - it's like a prompt thing
  - it's vaguely covered in the MS course
  - it's good to cover this (part of section 11)
  - 'xray vision' - peel away the azure stuff

- a lot of people are copying OpenAI API for their own models to make it easier to switch models
  - just pretend you're talking to OpenAI

- agents vs LLMs?
  - agents are more autonomous
  - agents may be using LLMs under the hood
  - agents is a way of using models
  - models are a thing; how we interact with models is typically a chat interface
  - users don't interact with a raw model
    - there's a fine-tuning process that morphs a raw model into a chat assistant
  - we can interact with the assistant through an API, not just a chat interface
  - other models get fine-tuned into different modalities - like video or audio
  - agents are a way to deploy interaction in a more automated way without user input
  - more if-else statements 
    - e.g., like a cron job
    - in that time, it's not YOU providing interface, there's an automated aspect of the AI that's called an "agent"
  - in it's simplest form, what is it?
  - what is automation in general?
    - it's a cron job
  - an agentic system can make a decision "on its own"
    - e.g., "go buy concert tickets" - could set some rough boundaries, but then, let the agent make decisions:  e.g., what seats, how "expensive"? access payment mechanisms, agentic systems can complete these systems on their own within some constraints that you set
    - hard constraints are what we're used to: e.g., don't spend over $200;  with AI, you can have fuzzy constraints
    - in the past, you had to write a script manually, with AI, you can be more open
      - using agent systems you can build little actions that the AI can choose (e.g., scrape a website for ticket prices) - almost like installing a library for ticketmaster scraper (but more automated)
      - AI-based agentic systems, is a bit like automated npm install - rely on AI to do common things
    - how agents work will change
    - there are agent frameworks out there
      - people add in common behaviours "microbehaviours" which add up to behaviours
      - these are micro-rules and tasks
      - allowing an AI to perform specific tools on its own and perform the next action
      - e.g., looking for flight status - it will actually display the flights (it will click on the links, etc. not just respond with the link)

  - AI + UX conference in Hawaii
    - there were a lot of people from Meta
    - head of AI at meta - was talking about agents
    - it's very hard to define what agents are right now
  
  - new model from runway ML - can now produce autogen clips of human faces for 5 secs
    - it looks very realistic
    - in a couple of years, could probably make movies

- "guardrails"
  - could be a library
  - is also a VC-backed company
  - some are hard-coded
  - some evals are LLMs (LLM-as-judge)
    - would use a different model
  - some websites may spoof - create links for tickets, etc to a fake ticket
  - guardrails may be necessary - you may not be able to hard-code everything


- guardrails and evals - big topics
  - prompt injectsions are a thing
  - hallucinations are a thing
  - dbs still have SQL injection attacks, it's just been around for much longer

- find "0-days" (vulnerabilities that exist now)
  - these vulnerabilities are sold to governments, and governments may use these to hack into other people
  - the team that finds these vulnerabilities get paid a lot to keep these quiet
  - sometimes these things have "bounties"


- DAGs
  - don't get distracted by that for now
  - graphs are very important to computing
  - a lot of it is abstracted away - we don't need to write this stuff
  - if you care, you would write it in a lower-level language
  - just use the libraries (e.g., neo4j - has been around for at least 20 yrs)
    - need to ramp up on graph knowledge
    - just like you don't want to write SQL in OO
    - should use an ORM
    - Object Relational Mapper - maps Object code to the relational (SQL) world
      - active record is a strategy
      - in the java world - large db deployments with multiple dbs (each with 100s of tables)
      - would have to map OO class diagrams to the ERDs for the DBs
        - user.save() may go to many different places - e.g., billing db, user db, etc.
        - ORMs could do this for you and provide transactional support for multiple dbs
        - very complicated
  - DAGs:
    - there are a lot of abstractions that need to be created
    - neo4j was heavily represented - they've made a comeback, partially with graphQL
      - graphQL queries feed naturally into graph dbs - which ended up being neo4j
    - knowledge graphs
      - they're pushing hard on knowledge graph + RAG
    - they should have a wrapper - we shouldn't have to worry about it
    - it will likely end up being an optimization
      - they might expose something in their API to let you play with DAG
    - need to do RAG first
    - then do RAG + knowledge graph
    - then would optimize afterwards
      - no more than 15 mins overview video


- by Friday:
  - finish the MS course
    - work as hard as you can
    - we're the first group going through this
    - PhD appetite for consuming knowledge is insane - that's not expected
    - pace depends on what we tell Chris
    - finish lesson 18 by the end of this week


- Alex has been messing around with ML - has a PhD
  - he read a lot
  - Chris told him to code more and read less
  - he works for ZML (?)


- recommends google colab
  - ipynb files are jupyter notebook files can be opened in google colab
  - depending on how they're made, they are pretty standalone
  - looks like you can run those notebooks in google colab
  - should be easy to create and share - send links, etc.
  - if you make a fix you can share it, etc.

  - we should be able to play around with code blocks in the notebook, etc.
