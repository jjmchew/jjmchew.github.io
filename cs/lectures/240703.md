# Wed Jul 3, 2024 - meeting with Chris

- context aware answers
  - e.g., "talk to a pharmacist"
  - e.g., "LS"
    - e.g., student:  should I learn functional programming?
      - LS:  we have some concepts, but you can learn it later
      - if you learn OOP first, most functional programming tutorials will contrast to OOP, hence, learn OOP first, functional programming later
  - being context-aware:  need to know what ecosystem you're in
    - LS:  don't want the general GPT answer
    - context-aware chat is so important
    - building context is augmenting info
    - want to use context to be aware of the environment the model is being deployed in
  - pharmacist:  a lot of personal information is necessary to understand medications
    - it's very sticky when you have the patient data and patients are used to working with a specific doctor or pharmacist
    - patients don't want to switch doctors or pharmacists
    - switching and re-building familiarity with another doctor or pharmacist is often difficult or an obstacle - serves to retain customers

- need to build stuff?
  - CL:  don't think we need to hit buzzwords to impress software engineers
  - don't be "buzzword" driven
  - we're still in the breadth phase

- CL:  if you want to build a context-aware AI system
  - secondary problem is building the pipeline
  - deployment issues:  switching models, eval frameworks, etc.
  - CL is looking for existing examples or products that are RAG-oriented

  - keep an eye out for products or services in that space


- question on LS use case - e.g., specific response to questions about functional programming
  - can this be created as a set of "guardrails" after LLM output is generated?

  - CL answer: are you familiar with exception handling?
  - JC: high-level only - e.g., try/catch blocks
  - catch exceptions best practice:
    - catch specific exceptions vs high-level general exceptions
      - capturing generic exceptions are hard to deal with
      - e.g., you can provide specific actions for errors, etc.
    - if you catch an exception, what should you
      - you should do as little as possible
      - the more you do, the more errors you can cause
      - should log (hopefully your log doesn't blow up)
      - you may need to throw another exception (e.g., if the module is being used in many different places)
      - you might not be close to the user interface (whoever is using that code can catch that exception)
        - if you're close to the user interface, you can send a helpful error message, etc.
    
    - in RAG - could be similar
      - guardrails could be similar:  e.g., just reject output
      - however, intuition is that you don't want to do a lot more processing in the guardrail
      - you could do the "catching" (e.g., if-else logic) upfront - prior to 
      - retrieve the correct documents, might writeup some content on functional programming to retrieve it as part of the content that gets input to RAG
      a lot of the content from Chris is on videos, podcasts, etc.
        - by pulling transcriptions it allows that content to be included
      - AI could still answer in a context-aware way
    - intuition is that "forking" should take place BEFORE LLM rather than afterwards as guardrails
