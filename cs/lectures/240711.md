## meeting with Chris

- JC:  logos?
  - we should start to think about it for next week

- CL:  wanted to dive deeper into RIAB and evals

- GL && BB demo
  - implemented RAGAS into LangFuse portal
  - can use any eval framework - and call LangFuse add score
  - ragas is only python
    - yesterday's demo was converted to typescript
  
  - CL:  we should use AI tools so we know how they work
    - used cursor a bit - worked well

  - RAGAS
    - hard to break apart "pieces" of pipeline
    - may want to now use LangChain in the future
    - for now, just evaluating the answer from LangChain pipeline

    - metrics can vary:  answer_relevancy is 1 out of 7 metrics
      - the documentation say specific metrics may use LLMs, but answer_relevancy did not ask for an API key

    - then used LangFuse client to add trace to that client

    - can tie evaluation to each trace
    - OR you can post-humously (get batch of data from Langfuse - get historic data)

    - observability - LangFuse
    - CL:  observability may or may not be part of RIAB
      - observability and eval seem to converging
        - observability frameworks are adding evals, evals are adding observability
      
    - CL:  business models are unbundling or bundling
      - for capstone:  should we unbundle?  or bundle?
      - putting things together can be complicated, so if we bundle, it might be the "kitchen sink, but simplified"

      - could focus on convenience - make it easy to "rip out" a component and then replace it with another

    - GL:  LangFuse has a low-level SDK - can use either LangChain or LlamaIndex

  - GL: preference to focus on eval rather than tracing
  
  - CL:  intuition - would want eval first (and visualization for evals)
    - observability second - wouldn't know where to poke around
  
  - CL:  graph from DeepEval was important
    - there are too many things you can change - need to have evals to understand the outcome from making changes

  - CL:  don't know if we need to use LangFuse
    - is RAG a solved problem?
    - wants more investigation

  - CL:  all capstone projects have a bring your own infra pitch
    - so you can do whatever you want with that infra
    - can setup alerts, etc.


- JC:  demo Langflow

- CL:  question for team
  - we could do product or infra
  - product might have less risk : it will look cool
    - with plinko, people had a tendency to downplay it
    - with this RAG project, as long as we can articulate what we did (not just use 2 libraries)
    - same risk with infra, but also need to be able to discuss
    - people still want to know the size of the chunks you use to glue the project together

  - building a product 
    - need to talk through the feature set, but have to NOT get too salesy
    - focus on talking about the tech that supports the features
      - NOT the features
  
  - what direction do we want to go?
  - biggest concern is that we do too much
    - you can see how many options there are
    - might be able to skim off the top and bundle
    
    - direct integration with discord and slack and a react component would be great
      - a "developer convenience story"
      - theoretically, any dev could build rails, but it's much easier to use something proven

      - deploy to their own cloud
      - feed it some documents, and then you have a slackbot
      - easy to modify - open source, can play with it (just like you would if it's your own)

- JC:  deployment was tough in Langflow
- CL:  deployment should be easy like most capstone projects
  - put in your slack key, you get a slackbot
  - UI-centric projects make it hard since there are so many different options

  - we can be opinionated, like rails (RoR)

  - we can define the kinds of accounts you need and then you're ready to go
    - future work will be making things more interchangable
    - for now we have eval out of the box, best of breed according to us, etc.

  - end goal is easy deployment and let users interact with documents, check evals

- GL:  could focus on ability to experiment with RAG pipelines
  - CL:  could have master eval? main dashboard, etc.
  - could start with evals and then add-on from there
  - CL: could just start with open-source evals (e.g., RAGAS)

  - CL:  data pipeline projects can be hard to get people to listen to it
    - also hard when people have done data pipelines for 20 yrs
    - in this project, it might be easier to find a friendly ear

    - the friendly-ear might be easier to find here
    - but evals could be a tough sell if people don't understand RAG or the need for evals

    - having a product aspect should help grab people's attention a bit more
      - ideally, people want people to be interested


- GL:
  - this is product in a sense (UI)
  - infra in the sense that it can be deployed 
- CL:
    - cloud-based, and some separation of concerns
    - ready to scale
    - can do some load-testing afterwards
    - scalability is a custom thing for every app
    - not a point of emphasis for us
    - we'd just be getting ready for that
  - hopefully people won't get stuck on the product and the value of it
  - the harder part might be getting people to understand it's not just a wrapper for OpenAI or a wrapper for InKeep
    - the question is "what is scratch"?
    - the more "from scratch" the more impressed people get


- CL:  let's sit on this idea

- CL:  from video interviewing business
  - HigherView had a "call us"
  - CL's company was just log in
  - HigherView went and logged in after they found out - they messed around and clicked around

- CL:  license differences
  - MIT:  do whatever you want, but I'm not liable
  - other licences may be more restrictive
    - e.g., do whatever you want, but you must do it open-source, but you can't make money (e.g., Apache 2, GPL - depends on how you bundle, you may have to maintain some license consistency)
  - BSC, MIT-  : similar to free
  - llama-3 : license is do whatever you want, but if you have a large enough user base, you can't use this
    - if you're a startup that uses this at your core, it might make it harder to be acquired

  - there's some potential for the project to be "a thing"
    - there's a non-zero chance that there could be some value

  - with a more restrictive license, people are less likely to look at those projects
    - companies may not use your project if it has a funny license
    - we might have a cool combination of bundles
  
  - CL: only says that since he trusts our research
    - we're looking at a different combination of solutions to a familiar problem

- CL:  think about project ideas
  - write it out with words
  - it would be great to have some semi-concrete ideas by tomorrow to think about tomorrow
  - need to commit shortly


- JC:  what level of detail to write about
  - CL:  write an executive summary if you have a more detailed document
  - infra projects are sometimes confusing
    - sometimes people don't understand until the end while people are doing a write-up

- GL:  will continue looking at other projects with an eye to see if our project idea is viable
- CL:  we can start to target our ideas a bit
  - it might be worth looking at more apps like RAGFlow
  - some boxes are nouns, some are verbs
  - GL:  Dify - devs had thick accents

- CL:  being opinionated may not be a bad thing
  - Ruby on Rails - Dave Hanson made choices just because he liked things like that
    - "he said I don't care about stored procedures" - if you don't like it, don't use this
    - accessing instance variables from different classes was a rails thing
    - he didn't care about other people
    - an extreme example of conviction - if you have conviction, people will listen

  - don't feel like you have to make everyone happy
    - this was not designed by committee - this wasn't designed for you
    - he cared about building stuff and impact to users

  - if it's open source - you can "rip it up"
    - once it's up, it will work, how cool is that


- CL:  Gen AI on AWS book : might just jump to Chapter 9
