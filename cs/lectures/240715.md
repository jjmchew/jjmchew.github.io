## Meeting with Chris

- wants to add more process
  - e.g., use basecamp with daily update - person responsible to update needs to talk to all teammates ("forced communication")
    - summarize what everyone has done for the benefit of everyone
  - could rotate the lead on this
    - people may summarize the day incorrectly - people should check and make corrections
    - those little tweaks are very important - need to stay aligned
    - length of the project based on time spent is important - if you go down 8 hrs of split that can be a big difference
      - don't want to drift too far
      - this is a big drawback to being remote
      - need to stay aligned!
  - can't just work independently until there's a reason to talk - it's too hard
  - need to force a duration that our group is together
    - at least a couple of hours a day together
    - at least a quarter of that time synchronous
    - the biggest risk in all capstone projects is everyone staying aligned
  - #1 failure for startups is:
    - founder conflict
    - #2 is running out of money
    - it's not building the wrong thing - you'll definitely build the wrong thing - you just run out of perseverance since you don't like the people you're working with

  - research can be individual
  - it's not divide and conquer
    - it's divide, conquer and COMBINE

- BB: halfway through Langchain book
  - might be best to use LangChain in modules

- CL:  LS uses rails and redis for quick caching
  - switching out redis and postgres is easy
  - can't really rip out rails
  - code is hard to change - LangChain is the code

  - should be justified in using LangChain and llamaIndex for other people
    - it may be better to rely on a framework

- GL: spent weekend getting to know llamaIndex
  - has a demo of LlamaIndex

- JC:  read llamaIndex book
  - leaning towards LlamaIndex
  - CL:  be careful about voicing opinions (langChain vs llamaIndex)
    - LangChain is very popular


- TL:  started graphRAG course and deeplearning
  - it might solve problems of very focused queries
  - CL:  be careful about graphRag - our use case may not go that way
    - it's still fresh as a topic
    - it may be a "financially-incentivized problem" - a problem that's been created since there's money being throw at it
    - a lot of people are pushing graphRAG and that makes CL suspicious
      - sees a lot of vendors pushing it, doesn't really hear practitioners saying it's solved problems
      - CL doens't know what to think about graphRAG at the moment

  - started a LlamaIndex course

- CL:  we need to stay aligned
  - we need to coordinate - we need to be more strategic, need to timebox things
  - now our time is team's time
  - don't just go off and do individual things
  - moving forwards need to stay aligned with our knowledge base
  - 1 person doing other things isn't useful

  - we need to stay more connected, team-orientation, need to work together

- CL for tomorrow:
  - problem space, existing solutions, our solution
  - don't need implementation details yet
  - we all need to search for an architecture diagram
    - need to find a bunch - things that we seem we can do and that we can take bits and pieces from
    - how flexible should our RAG be?
    - could select some models or possibly just select 1
    - this informs our architecture, UX, etc.
    - what does our pipeline look like
    - we'll use 1 or more as inspiration for our pipeline

  - team name important for name and logo to be on pace
    - don't pick anything super casual, or anything that collides with anything super popular
    - most capstone projects are 1 word, could also be multiple words
    - should be easy to say, easy to say fast, and recognizable

  - daily updates - CL will read them
    - we need to decide as a team
    - some teams every single person writes a report - also fine
    - some teams also constantly meet and their reporting is just for their mentor
    - CL won't read all reports - will still ask someone to generate a single report with a few bullets (CL will read)

  - need to start thinking about implementation path
    - be okay with throw-away prototypes
    - spend more time with prototypes - need to produce code
    - use AI coding assistance - use it all
    - thinks its important to generate things, don't just read - build things

  - in debates - code wins - it's not talk
    - coding is work, it's not about winning, but it proves out the work you do
    - higher-paying jobs have less structure
    - people need to be *shown* what works

    - we should start using cursor.ai and copilot - it's harder to get stuck
      - installing and managing environments used to be very difficult
      - had to uninstall and install GEMS as required
      - bundler was so much better
      - java tooling was great, ruby tooling was less developed
      - bundler is still an excellent package manager

      - cold start problem can be hard - environment setup, etc.  AI will help


- GL demo basic RAG app in llama_index:
  - biggest difference with Langchain - code is optimized for improving RAG
  - import document, then split (chunks referred to as nodes)
  - llamaIndex creates indexes - SummaryIndex and VectorStoreIndex
  - need to create a QueryEngine

  - BB:  chaining that llamaIndex does?
    - what's the best thing to do for this use case?
    - e.g., vectorIndex vs RateIndex - can it be chained? (i.e., do both?)


- GL:  Mendable.ai
  - another InKeep competitor
  - CL:  could be worth following-up - it's not just a status report - need to educate teammates


- CL:  make sure your team mates are on board
  - just need to communicate with team and Chris
  - years of teaching coding has rounded out his knowledge of coding SO MUCH more - almost more than then previous 10 yrs of just coding and building
  - when presenting - be okay with not knowing and just doing more research
  - take advantage of the opportunity to share info with everyone
  - everyone levels up
  - imagine the level-up we can all have if we can do this


- CL:  wants to add pressure - we should meet the capstone deadline
  - wk1 of the job hunt there is stuff assigned
  - job hunt mentor will also be assigned - need to take advantage of that time
  - they're only around for a 8 or 10 weeks
  - don't slip by more than 1 week
  - try to respect the deadline
  - don't pull all-nighters - try to pull deadlines



## Chris priorities
- improve communication and collaboration
  - think of our time as team time
  - be strategic
  - remember deliverables to the team
  - doesn't matter if we learn something
  - need to timebox - can't do things for a week on our own

  - we need to meet more frequently
  - or create a LOOM, etc to communicate better

  - need to start collecting things somewhere so that Chris can see what's going on
  - write-ups, etc.
  - put code, repos, etc. in there

  - improving R&D effort, cross-collaboration


- name and logo - CL is getting pressure

- use case refinement
  - we could individually write (and then read) our own versions of the use case

  - writing IS thinking

- CL:  it's hard to improve on things when people are too emotional
  - people who are fearful are the hardest to work with
  - too many emotions mixed up with work


- CL: ultimately, write-up is the key
  - people will not be able to perceive this project - they want to talk about it
  - they'll have "a lot of questions"
