# 

- schedule: every single person needs to contribute something
  - people have to talk about something every day
  - pretend Chris is our manager
  - we need to push updates to Chris - he doesn't assume we're working unless we share something
  - Chris is inundated with basecamp notifications - we need to push info to Chris - e.g., via Slack Mentor channel
  - eventually we're not going to meet every day (when we get to implementation)
    - then we'll meet twice a week or less since we need to get to work
  - CL will still need daily updates
  - he wants to know what we're working on
  - for work, it's important to keep people posted
  - you can't be embarrassed - it's best to look bad now in Capstone
  - use this as practice
    - CL will give feedback

- Nick is on Chris - getting a lot of pressure on timelines
  - all of the other teams are doing MVP demos later this week
  - we need to have something
  - MVP - development goes fast if you know what you're doing
  - 3 or 4 days to code should be okay
  - worse case - we show some code and show an architecture diagram

  - will try to make demos available for everyone to see what everyone else is doing

- should do internal diagram review tomorrow with Chris
  - it doesn't have to be AWS, but it could look better with some icons, etc.

- demos should be just 10 - 15 minutes

- it may look ambitious, but we've been doing reviews
  - there may be critical decisions to be made
  - are we committed to LlamaIndex? or roll our own?
    - what pieces within and pieces outside?
    - how do they come together?
    - if 80% of components are within LlamaIndex - that's okay
      - just take an xray into LlamaIndex and explain those bits to people

      - have had projects like that before - just "xray" into it
        - e.g., if you use a dockerized open-source tool and we "wrap" that product - if too much magic is inside the container
        - never show code - just talking about architecture diagram, when we show people how things work
        - then they zoom into the container, talk about deployment, etc.


- design decisions between now and Thursday
  - decide what pieces we combine with LlamaIndex to deploy to facilitate our use case
  - how far can we push on use case
  - phase 1 is just RAG deployment
  - phase 2 is add more feature set - ways that end users can interact, react components, etc.
  - we should be able to deploy multiple bots
    - e.g., ChrisBot, PeteBot, grab everyone's messages as knowledge base - it would be 2 different

  - we need to decide on multi-tenancy or single-tenancy
    - we could keep it simple:  if you want 2 different bots, we would have 2 different deployments



- CL:  for Thursday - wants to see how this "hits him" (the guy we'll be speaking with)
  - wants to see his reaction
  - should start with quick overview of the use case
  - we can zoom in or fast forward
  - we can ask about whether or not we should skip the "rag" part
  - start with use case
  - then get into architecture
  
  - GL:  is time worth it?
    - CL:  super casual - don't overdo it
      - some things like graphRAG may be beyond their knowledge
      - probably no one expects you to talk about things with confidence
      - just say "we're exploring it"
      - we need to know what we want to know well (i.e., identify the "core")
    - CL:  any feedback is good - even negative
      - it's about uncovering blind spots
        - not worried about things we know
      - what should we think about w.r.t. architecture
      - data pipeline is a big topic
      - helping people clean and normalize data before embedding is important
        - we won't do that - clean PDFs, etc.
        - if you have unstructured.io account, you can use that
        - we want to acknowledge we're aware of things 


- CL:  when requesting feedback
  - need to define what level of feedback to give
  - "fibonacci feedback" - 10, 20, 30, then loosen up
    - you confine the space where things can go wrong
    - CL likes to get involved a lot early on and then just checkpoints later
    - 30 / 90 is a good general rule

- CL:  we can just sign-up for mendable, etc.
  - if that's blocking, we should sign-up

- GL:  demo mendable
  - each project is a chatbot
  - first thing is add data sources
  - CL:  these apps don't seem to have a data pipeline (no control over that);  level of abstraction with tooling is quite high

  - CL:  we have 2 audiences:
    - 1. dev ops : is lower-level to tweak things
      - CLI is most basic : "ops" admin
      - but could also provide more choices on bits of infra
    - 2. departments : ui for config admin
    - 3. end chatbot users : just chat ui

  - GL:  demo:  can set prompt (templates) and model
    - can use just own data source or external data sources
    - prompt editing
    - can use playground to see chatbot in action

  - GL:  deploying - "Tools and Actions"
    - agents may require more cost

  - CL:  if we get enough features in, people probably won't accuse us of just wrapping a model
    - want to make it obvious that engineering is happening
    - don't need to do RAGFlow + Mendable - don't need to do 2 things
    - if we were looking for funding it might be worth it, but as a capstone project, it might be aggressive


  - CL:  should chunking be per project?
    - CL:  we need to decide what's exposed
    - CL:  it's likely easier to just have 1 admin panel - just the "user" UI
    - the Ops UI would just be CLI

  - GL:  providing the API key allows the API to know data to use

  - CL:  might not use mendable - don't want to load data into cloud
    - may want to use own infra

  - CL:  Ops admin - just CLI
    - then just user admin UI and 'settings' that privileged users can access (e.g., deployment wide settings, advanced settings or admin settings)
      - e.g., which db, which model, etc.
      - to really mess with infra - have to log into AWS and use cloud tools - that makes sense
      - only basic high-level things within the user UI

    - mendable - would be a great 

- CL:  when AWS started - they used to be primitives
  - now (has developed over time) - they've developed "packaged" services
  - if everyone installs a db, now they create a service
  - they take common patterns that people do and extract them and give it a name

  - CL:  Bedrock is probably for us, SageMaker is probably for ML ops (fine-tuning, etc.)
    - Bedrock connects wtih existing models

  - CL:  Amazon - trying to own enterprise use cases
    - e.g., SSO (single-sign on)
    - Cognito are in the space of dealing with enterprise SSO
    - it's not part of mendable - will probably use a service
      - like Auth0 and integrate with auth that way
    
    - we should side-step that
    - GL:  OAuth?
      - CL:  OAuth is different than Auth0 (SSO)

    - CL:  JWT is a concept that we probably don't need
      - only front-end is the chat thing
      - JWT is not what mendable uses
      - they give a token and whitelist ls url
  
  - CL:  likes data side, eval side, serving side
    - great to see these 
  
  - CL:  with data versioning
    - we can take a much simpler approach
    - great to use resources to illustrate options

- CL:  it's awkward to be coding at this stage without architecture
  - before rooms are set in the house, it's easier to divide
  - until then, CL recommends pair programming
  - architecture should come first and start to develop intuition

  - it's okay for multiple people to make progress, but we have to come together
  - make sure to put on your teacher's hat for your teammates
    - will clarify for you, as well
  - as the project gets setup, it will be easier to break things up

  - if you don't help people out, then people just watch
  - make sure you ramp people up - in the long run it will hurt others

- CL:  push summaries to Chris

- GL:  we should start looking at architecture and building a skateboard?

CL: Yes
  - whatever we code has to follow some architecture
  - there are a lot of big decisions to be made - cloud choice
    - default should probably be AWS;  even if the company doesn't use AWS knowing it is great

  - need a deployment store (CLI)
    - someone needs to do it manually first
    - AWS is not awesome to use at first - there are a lot of pieces
    - once we get used to it, it can get more powerful
    - it's great opportunity - everyone will appreciate the fact that something is on AWS
