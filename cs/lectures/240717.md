## meeting w/ Chris

- CL:  indirectly knows someone who created LangTrace
  - just came across his radar
  - doesn't know them well, but might ask if they wanted to chat
  - CL wants external validation
  - We should get familiar with OpenTelemtry
    - a bunch of observability companies came up with a standard for all tools to abide by
    - it's a CNCF standard - Cloud Native Computing Foundation
    - if we did an OpenTelemtry observability project, we'd have to know about this
    - anything with observability, we'd need to be aware
    - their package adheres to this standard
    - some capstone grads are working in the OpenTel space - NewRelic is sponsoring an engineer to work on the standard
    - could possibly pitch as:  "we're thinking about 


- CL:  talking about uploading docs, etc to skateboard
  - brought up Max's project - talking about REALLY big video files
  - initially just get it up on AWS - transcoding
  - video files get transcoded to various formats
  - (CL has background in transcoding videos)
  - youtube produces probably a dozen different video files (resolutions, captioning, etc.)
    - need to have these videos ready to go to support a variety of devices, bandwidths
    - transcoding is very slow
  - there is an opportunity to use concurrent lambdas and then piece it together
    - each lambda has to have the entire video in memory
    - there is a limit to how this scales - they're just making a copy of the video
    - there are memory requirements with each lambda
    - we might need to craft our use case to exclude things we can't do
    - getting the architecture simpler is better - see their final architecture diagram - e.g., executor, transcoder, mergeInvoke, merge, etc.
    - db stores which lambda is in charge of which segment
    - there is a state management consideration (executor) - which chunks get completed, which chunks fail and need to be re-started

  - video transcoding pipeline

- could think about a chunking strategy for large files

- CL:  our diagram is a top-down view
  - there is also a pipeline view
  - either option is okay - there are pros and cons to either approach
  - for us top-down view might be better

- CL: Lambdas have 10gb limit

- CL:  EC2 instances - they take idle compute and package it up into spot instances
  - you're a second-class citizen - you can use their instance when it's idle, but as soon as they need it, you get punted
  - you can use spot instances when they're available


- CL:  are we ready to talk to Kevin tmrw?
  - GL:  walked through pitch deck
  - what Grace is doing is how you will get raises - need to package work together to show people

  - we might need a quick RAG write-up that we can use to "skip" forwards if people know about "RAG"

  - our scope is pretty wide
  - is it valid?
  - with RAG architecture with evals and integration - is it too wide?
    - should we just focus on RAG or chatbot, etc?
  - if we have a wide scope, it gives us a bit of a story around lack of depth - since it's end-to-end, we're not just "rag observability"
  - CL wants to check that story / use case with Kevin
  - does he say "that's interesting" or "that's too big"

- CL:  there are no experts in this space - except maybe the people who created the libraries
  - as long as we do homework, we should be okay - a test


- CL:  the ability to synthesize and present is so important
  - especially in a new field (like AI)
  - Deloitte story - packaging info for slightly technical people, doing presentations, etc. opened a lot of doors and gave him a reputation
  - teaching others is good for your reputation and clarifies the picture for yourself
  - use Capstone as practice, get out of the "just-code" mentality

- CL:  show him what we're doing since he doesn't know

- CL: tomorrow - keep it casual
  - see what his reaction is - write down his reactions, don't need to push back - follow-up and understand
  - our presentation should be around 10 mins, get to architecture, etc.
  - we need to communicate how we're thinking about our use case
  - need to talk about the wider use case - CL's biggest question - not sure if it's reasonable
