## meeting w/ Chris
- CL: summaries are good
  - make sure our update reflects the day's work
  - wants to encourage us to work together more
  - we should work in pairs and rotate pairs unless we're investigating different areas
    - sense is that we like to work independently
    - pairing is awkward - people have different speeds
    - generally, that's okay
    - pairing is forced in consultancies since people spend too much time thinking, instead of doing - it's helpful to do more
    - at minimum it's helpful to say let's each read and then talk
    - need to find higher ROI work
    - if you don't feel productive in a pair, then you can get more action-orientation

    - this shouldn't be a solo-exercise
    - we shouldn't be surprised by what other people are doing
    - CL likes the presentation - just wants to sit through 4 x 15 minute presentations

    - status reports are good and allow for course-corretions
    - but if we work individually too much, it may not be high ROI

    - not everyone needs to know AWS - someone needs to know details
      - if you're not sure, then just zoom out and know how 1 detailed component works

      - this will get easier once we figure out the architecture
      - until we get there, we should pair
      - even a 4 person pair could work - it's exhausting
      - 2 person pairs are fine as well, need to see progress
      - we're being forced to communicate
    
    - CL doesn't like 4 person and updates - we have a schedule
      - we need to finish in 3 weeks, can't spend another week being fuzzy

  - write-ups - should be started in 1 week
    - there is a bit of buffer time, but we need more
  
  - CL:  db doesn't matter - just pick 1 that sounds reasonable - it will be fine
    - think about Kevin's considerations - it's decision-time

    - then implement

  - CL:  Monday - wants to see a detailed architecture diagram
    - we need to 4 person pair it
    - CL will run it by Kevin again - wants his review
    - we should give him notes on things we've talked about

    - we gotta build
    - there's a lot
    - best not to worry about slack integration

    - we might be able to use terraform - do it from CLI

    - if we make decisions, people can go investigate things


    - we should antagonize over the "wrong choice" - any of the right choices is okay
      - as long as we have 3 right choices then it's okay
      - just pick one

    - if we're not sure, look at previous projects, ask others
      - then just go for it


    - check previous projects to understand how to build command line tools - someone has to go investigate that
      - need to look at previous projects and pick a tool
      - those people are around, so we can ask and it should be pretty quick


  - we need to "apply knowledge" now
    - we need people to "scout", not do independent research
    - once we know an approach - we decide
    - then we implement

- CL: could make a project plan for us if we want
  - we should decide

- CL:  when he looks at the update - it's unstructured
  - he wants to see more structure in what we're working on
  - it looks like divide and conquer, but it's time to combine
  - CL: wants to see a more cohesive update


- CL:  will try and find more resources for AWS - something changed

- CL:  Tues demo moved to 11:30 am PT - to be confirmed with Nick

- CL:  we need an architecture diagram
  - Nick will want to see it as well

  - CL:  see comment in Ben's write-up
  - we need to assume an AI use-case - can't assume a different use case and then use RAG
  - it would be helpful to point to a white-paper to indicate it's a default way of working with AI

  - then we get into what RAG is
  - then we can get into RAGaaS works, then walk through mendable
  - people need to understand mendable, then we can talk about our program
  - then show architecture diagram

  - then show progress

  - showing code without lead-up will just create questions
  - the more UI / automation / etc the better
  - worst case, we just show AWS dashboard

- GL:  question about use case
  - narrowed down use-case by role is "SMB that has a dev team but insufficient time to build a product from scratch"
  - for a company that wants an internal chatbot for internal use - hence byoc is important
  
  - CL:  this is natural - since any situation where you have your own infra and you don't want to ul your docs to any service, including OpenAI
    - if you have own infra, you have an IT team
    - so that's good
    - for IT team to spin up a knowledge-augmented AI system for their company, they would likely need to use a framework - it's hard to build it on your own
    - spinning up a project is "hard" - so we need to talk about that
    - it's like any framework you use - we could code up React, but it's super helpful to have patterns that experienced developers have faced, and solutions to that
      - CL:  same proposition here
      - you could do your own, but then you'd have to do your own research again and stitch things together
    - need to assume AI for use case, otherwise, jumping straight to RAG is a bit sudden

- GL:  considerations like file-type, or versioning, or doc-upload frequency, etc. might need more specific use case
  - CL:  is "documentation" sufficient?  just need to talk about text-based content - i.e., not video, etc.  multi-model story is in flux right now (we could always use video transcripts)
  - capstone alum is playing with GPT-4o-mini - playing with it - pricing is cheap, but images: older model 84 tokens, but new model created more tokens - ended up being the same total cost, even though it was more tokens
    - it could be theoretically be higher resolution, but cost-wise, it didn't make a difference
  - capability updates makes everything different


- CL:  why would someone be concerned with ul docs to open-AI?  and not AWS service?
  - GL:  isn't a company's db and data hosted on AWS, anyway?
  - CL:  good
  - CL:  also, when using SaaS, you have to give up privacy, knowingly
    - the fact that CL can see launchschool content should be known
    - for infra - there's a different expectation
    - for infra, no one should be looking at data on the db
    - note difference between product vs infra
    - AWS is weird since they combine infra pieces that look like products - moving "up the chain"
    - still tend to think of AWS as infra - hence there's a bit more "privacy" - feels like "ours"

- GL: does this mean we should try NOT to use OpenAI?
  - should we try using open-source models?
  - CL:  that might make sense in the future - could use AWS Bedrock - it's worth considering for bonus features

  - CL:  theoretically, we should trust OpenAI and AWS equally, but people don't necessarily think about it equally

- CL:   you don't need to build every feature
  - but you should be able to speak intelligently about features or concerns - even if you haven't built it

- CL:  EC2 is great for Tuesday
  - the way CL has proposed presentation, is good
  - CL:  would like to see leadup for Tuesday and back-and-forth to talk about it
  - CL:  create a diagram for current state - even if it changes in future
    - can then look at how to morph the architecture to make it look more like "services" and then automating it
    - can then start with dashboard, UI, etc.
    - chatbot - save that as a bonus feature

  - chatbot could almost be done afterwards depending on progress in final job hunt weeks
    - it more about showing off what the product can do
    - a bit like the webhook project - build the core and then tacked on the SDK at the end (over a weekend, created wrappers in a different language)


- CL: news
  - last minute trip - is going to Japan on Jul 25 for vacation - will commit to meeting 3x / week
    - proposing 5pm ET meeting times
    - next week Mon/Tues/Wed/ Fri(late since CL flies)



## Logo selection

- used "Rubik" font for logo - looked good generically - not too Helvetica, nothing strange about it - very neutral
