## meeting w/ Chris
- CL:  dont' be anxious
  - if you don't believe it will happen, it can be detrimental to you
  - don't worry about the larger doubts - about getting a job, etc.
  - just focus on the next steps - e.g., get the 2 services to connect
  - negativity spreads - teams are either super negative or super positive
  - no such thing as a neutral team
  - our team is in the negative
  - if you assume succes, it's just on how do we solve this
  - if we can't solve something as an individual, then ask the team, and if the team doesn't know, then we can ask external resources

  - don't treat Chris as a client
  - don't do that - then he can't help us
  - Chris isn't the client - he's supposed to be in the kitchen

  - he doesn't know how to use the TPS report
  - he wants to know how we feel
  - we need to tell each other how we feel
  - let's talk about how/why we're stuck
  - then we can talk about why and analyze

  - he wants to see an architecture diagram
  - he spent 2 hrs on document and no one made a comment
    - he felt like the team was checked out
    - we should give feedback

  - communication is so important

  - wants a safe space to chat - otherwise he's not sure how to move forwards

  - it shouldn't be so miserable - we should be struggling and having fun - that's ideal

  - Chris offered to do more hands on support with milestones, etc.

- BB, TL: both want more directed attention
- GL:  has spent a lot of time telling people what to do
- CL:  happy to step in and provide control

- CL:  an architecture diagram is used to divy up tasks
  - if we're exploring, then people need to focus on it, and the others can do something else
  - there's too much work to do
  - e.g., write-up outline
  - delegation of tasks

- CL:  doesn't see a lot of communication - we need to talk to each other more

- CL:  UI is a thing that someone can just work on

- JC:  talked about current state architecture diagram
  - UI, ingestion, evals
- GL: wants to pair with BB to work on evals and login to mendable and figure out the UI

- GL: is what we're doing acceptable?
- CL:
  - we need to be at least as good as people who are making stuff on the web
  - as working software engineers this is roughly about right
  - it's a first step
  - there are a lot of RAG frameworks out there
  - we have some ideas
  - polish is good too - i.e, the UI could get dressed up

  - don't get stuck on AWS
  - we could spiff up the UI - CSS, etc.

  - we have our fiverr logo - don't underestimate that
  - it could be a full-time person's work

- CL:  polish is a way to differentiate
  - there are other things we can evolve to once we get the skateboard working

- CL:  he doesn't want "facts" on the daily report
  - he wants to see us doing work
  - a large part of the write-up are things we've overcome
  - we need to have ae list of that stuff for the write-up
  - we need an inventory of items we've overcome
  - we can pick 3 to mention, etc.
  - all of them are interview talking points
  - it's okay and good to struggle - write it all down
  - it's great to package these problems together
  - a lot of these capstone writeups include a "challenges" section
    - how the design came to be
    - that's the most interesting part of the project
    - it's worth taking inventory
    - since we don't touch every piece - we should still be able to talk about ingestion, evals, etc.
    - so these logs are useful - challenges and how we overcome them

  - CL:  also wants to know about challenges
    - do something that makes sense for everyone
    - he's after utility
    - tell him what's useful for our group

  - CL:  got the vibe that things were terrible
    - the work looks good based on what he's seeing
    - inject some positivity - it doesn't have to be doom and gloom
    - increase the communication
    - we need to look at the narrative


  - narrative is critically important
  - mendable demo is also critical (since we're using it as our model project)
    - show people why RAG exists
    - tell people it's YC-funded - a shortcut for "this is a real problem"
    - but we don't want to use mendable, we created an open-source project
  
  - people need to know what problem we're tackling even if it doesn't work, yet

- CL:  Ben said he was stuck - why?
- BB:
  - felt at his limits juggling moving pieces and has low confidence
- CL:  how about the work?  (feelings for a separate conversation)
  - BB:  lambda to RDS had some issues
    - couldn't get RDS to work, kept changing the goal posts and getting further away from what he wanted
    - ended up with EC2 and postgres
    - lost faith in the ability to follow the steps
  - CL:  set aside the doubt
    - if you can't figure out the work, ask
    - don't tie your self worth to your AWS ability
    - don't inject meaning into your ability to work with AWS
    - self-doubt is hard - injecting those thoughts is hard
  - everyone has ability - just need to plug it into the right place
    - no one is judged on their ability on AWS - people are good at different things

  - CL: we don't divide the work based on who's awesome - we just divy
    - most capstone people do not work well with AWS
    - CL isn't good at AWS
    - it's important to keep trying
    - we should write about what we tried, how we got stuck, what we tried - zoom out and think about our role within the team

  - BB:  if he finds a dead-end - can he just work out to Chris directly?
    - CL:  write up a document with our research and our work
    - why isn't that a thing?
    - just write down what you're trying to do, what you did, here's current state
    - this way everyone can learn something
      - we need to know what other people have tried
      - this will provide a starting point for the next person
  
  - CL:  in the process of writing,  you can gain clarity and gain ideas
    - other people can come up with ideas, as well
    - don't get emotional, focus on the details
    - clarify for you, other people can chip in
    - worst case, other people will know what road to go down

    - focus on knowing how to hand-off work - there's an "unlock" - clarify things for everyone


- CL:  hardest part is knowing when to keep trying and when to stop
  - at least write down everything you've tried
  - then other people can offer help on whether to keep going or whether to stop
  - at the very least, people won't have to do the same things again

  - technical documents - CL can copy and paste challenges to alumni and ask if anyone has experience or can help

  - there are a lot of resources to bring

  - try not to trigger meta thoughts about yourself - solve technical problems

  - if you've finished core you're more than good enough

- TL:  ingestion should happen somewhere else other than the EC2 instance since it'll be blocking
  - CL:  put the jupyter notebook in one place - stick it in 1 place
  - we need a repository to go back and look at the challenges
  - lamba - tried to create layers, but they were all too big, llamaindex is too big, also
  - TL's red flag was about docker
    - 1/10 comfort with that
    - tried to look at other options
    - could spin up a new EC2 instance
  - CL:  docker is really a deployment concern
    - docker is a quality of life concern
    - we should be able to do this without docker
    - it will protect against changing environments

  - CL:  to get unblocked, just do it on EC2 for now
    - it's a great narrative for moving to lambda since people don't upload documents that often
    - so we need to move off ec2
    - not too long - a paragraph or 2 should be sufficient to see if someone has experience
  
    - just use ec2 to unblock

  - TL gets hung up on trying to fix all of the problems
  - CL:  keep working on making it work end-2-end with a subpar architecture
  - CL:  UI needs improvement since it'll be the first thing people see
    - write-up narrative
    - all of us should work on it - we might be under-estimating how big of an impact that is
    - people NEED to understand the problem first
    - otherwise, it's impossible to listen to discussions about architecture
    - for anyone who might be interested - don't overwhelm people
    - make things accessible - if it's confusing
      - assume that things are confusing if they don't understand, they don't assume that they're dumb
      - definitely need to help them understand

    - people definitely NEED TO understand the problem
      - mendable will help protect us
      - even if people don't understand the space
      - Look at BeeKeeper - a great write-up
      - promoted to senior after 6 months and promoted again
      - he took a casual style - CL likes this
      - don't be too academic - that's not how programmers read these articles
      - CL like Ryan's style - CL is trying to be more casual, make sure they understand

    - people need to understand
    - impress them with the CLARITY of your setup
      - hence a simple RAG is good enough

    - just the skateboard is enough and then we can keep modifying it afterwards if we want to

- CL:  make it work e2e
  - then migrate to end architecture
  - then split to separate services
  - then have everything on separate instances
  - this architecture can get pretty complicated
  - not worried about that

  - after the lead-up just show how the bits and pieces work

  - Nick is non-technically aware - should be like most hiring managers

  - Max is in the weeds and get more to the architecture - it might make sense to schedule something with him

- JC:  all present?
  - CL:  we could pair on presentation to practice
    - 2 on Nick
    - 2 on Max

  - we're encountering interesting problems - we just don't know it's interesting, yet

- CL:  beekeeper:
  - great diagrams
  - very interesting tech challenges
  - 1 guy did almost all of the AWS stuff
     - it probably wasn't Ryan
     - the guy who did all of the AWS stuff probably isn't getting paid the most

  - there's lots of work to be done

- CL:  we gotta make the UI pretty
  - have you considered getting a domain?
  - the most fun part is when the UI comes online - it'll be amazing
  - it's the most motivating
  - that's why front-end is so sexy

- CL:  Nick has seen all of the projects
  - so ask him what he thinks about the complexity of the project
  - CL hasn't talked to him yet about this
  - get his thoughts


- CL:  how can I help?
  - BB:  would it make sense to make sense to work on the proposal for tomorrow?
  - CL:  make a better scenario - test drive it with Nick
  - if Nick gives negatve feedback, don't defend, be an anthropologist - get more info
    - don't surpress or defend
    - keep pulling on the thread
    - negative feedback is great

  - CL may not be able to make demo tomorrow

- if you want a hosted version - that's anything to work on
  - e.g., user accounts, etc.
