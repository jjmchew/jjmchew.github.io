# Tues Jul 23, 2024

## demo with Nick
- high-level 1 min elevator pitch followed by demo and architectural diagram / discussion

- BB presenting
  - with slide deck
  - started at 2:04 pm
  - finished at ~2:19pm with architecture

- NM:  what does fine-tuning mean?
  - BB:  models are trained on a dataset
  - fine-tuning is adjusting how it thinks
  - feeding a model with more data
  - to help it understand the code

  - no more questions

- CL:  question:
  - when shown the RAG architecture - do you accept it as an obviously acceptable architecture or is more setup required to establish RAG as an industry-practice
  
  - NM:  knows generally what RAG is from convos's with Max and own research
  - because it matches his underestanding, he takes it as validation
  - no skepticism - it makes sense - the process we used makes a lot of sense

  - more time could be spent talking about the embeddings and the embedding process
    - could be the weakest - how is semantic meaning converted to numbers and able to be searched

  - architecture of RAG seems solid to him

- CL:  was it interesting seeing mendable UI?
  - in terms of how it looks, how using RAG looks

  - NM:  go back to screenshot of mendable
  - if you did the presentation again - it would help to call attention to selectable models, custom prompt, selectable models
  - highlight some of the customization in existing solutions, which we are also proposing for paisley

  - NM:  the mendable demo does give him a sense of "what's in the wild"

- JC:  any questions about other solutions?

  - NM:  this is one way of doing it for 1 particular use case
  - assumes there are other ways of doing it
  - the chat with docs - it was another iteration which focused on slightly different things
  - in the write-up it may have made sense to talk a bit about different things and then our own use case

- CL:  why did you choose Mendable as our model project?
  - NM:  from the employer point of view, it might help to set the scope of different options - we haven't really introduced them
  - CL: may want to introduce the "goldilocks" thing - "this one's too small", "this one's too big", etc.
  - NM:  it may help to talk about the ecosystem a bit
  - landing at mendable is fine, but we may need a bit of world-building

- CL:  liked the change on what if you need to change the model
  - CL:  could have emphasized your data is on mendable.com
  - data privacy is a key reason why you might reach for an open-source solution

  - NM:  did talk about why you might want to change the chunking strategy
  - didn't talk about why you might want to change the model
  
  - CL:  the giraffe.pdf could be "secretgiraffeknowledge" - highlight the "secret" nature of ouur knowledgebase


- NM:  this is the last week for implementation according to schedule
  - but it's just a rough "line in the sand" - it's okay to keep implementing
  - some teams "peel off people as they go" to work on write-ups and diagrams
  - should figure out who will be doing write-up and diagrams
  - Note:  diagrams are important

  - NM:  we're on-track, but a bit behind on implementation progress
    - having a good idea of what to build is great - usually once you know, it's much faster



## meeting w/ Chris
- was that useful?  Being forced to talk out loud?

- we can do more of these
- can pull in alumni - might have a broader variety of backgrounds
  - we can do a variety of pitches to help us practice the pitch and refine it

- CL:  not worried about implementation
  - use all resources at Capstone - find a way forward and figure it out
  - there's too much talent among the team and broader community

- challenge us to think about final architecture diagram

- CL:  evals didn't hit Nick since he's not in the space
  - the other stuff, etc. is less interesting to Nick
  - it would be interesting to see what questions Max asks
  - people in the know will have different questions
    - e.g., Max may ask about LlamaIndex
  - we should be prepared for those kinds of questions - volunteer more technical info so that he can ask more questions

  - it's great to get more practice talking about that part
