## meeting w/ Chris
- CL:  feeling good?
  - looked at documents - it looks really good
  - there's a bit of discussion around eval stuff
  - are we stuck? or was that brainstorming?

  - BB:  brainstorming

  - CL:  while reading eval notes:
    - if we don't know the schema - just capture the data first and foremost
    - then you run a separate process to make it structured (e.g., for analytics)
    - this is a common service
    - could use postgres jsonB type, etc.
    - could use a different service (e.g., nosql, key-value store or document store)
    - then run a process to normalize afterwards
  
  - CL: another service could be data-processing
    - ETL : it just means changing data from 1 structure to another
    - ETL could be a python script - you could just have 3 scripts on a cron job
    - if the requirements get more severe, you might make each piece "bigger"

  - CL is getting ready for his flight
    - if we encounter something blocking again - ping Nick and Max (and Chris, but don't wait for him)
    - it's likely that they'll do what Chris is doing - they'll just ask around
    - if you get stuck - try - do some work, give enough detail that people can identify a potential solution

  - don't do CI/CD - only if you can do it fast
    - CL:  his experience wasn't the best - it broke
    - then spent a lot of time debugging it
    - even if you spend time to fix it, it'll likely still break
    - github flow - is very rigid for large teams
      - you could bend it to our team
    - for commits - once we choose not to throw away code anymore
      - how many repos do we need?
      - might be 3 or 4 different
      - if you pair, commit with both names - okay if 1 person did most of the work, just include people's names - don't get too skewed
      - just want to show that people are working
    - natural for projects to have different points of emphasis for different areas
      - a project of this size - no one will ask about where you commit
    
    - managing multiple environments across multiple services - this is very difficult
    - don't create a new problem
    - if we were going to work on this for years, but it may not be worth it
      - there are tools for this
    
    - at the command line - get the user to enter a prefix - you need to keep track of what services belong to which instance
      - just keep track
      - makes it easy to "blow things away"
      - may want to tear-down by prefix
    
- CL:  horror story with enterprise product
  - by the end of the project: they were cutting scope and decided to use an updater
  - the guy who created the updater got fired

- JC:  question about testing vs feature build
  - CL:  test is code too - there are diminishing returns
  - some tests are important
  - you can't stub too much since it doesn't reflect reality
  - testing isn't a 1 shot deal - if you see things breaking, add tests
  - for capstone:  the ROI is mostly in conversations - i.e., what's your testing story - just need to have an answer to that question
  - in a service-oriented architecture, may be a lot of self-testing
    - tests are brittle in this environment, as well
    - don't want to be debugging tests more than code
    - you could spend a few days debugging tests
  - you should have tests
    - everyone knows that testing in this environment is hard - it's not a great story - it's more infrastructure for testing
    - there are fancy testing techniques, but they all involve more services and infra
    - you could use an off-the-shelf thing, but there are other options

  - famous pattern for testing:  Netflix uses AWS
    - they didn't know how to test so just do it randomly (chaos monkey)
    - it's an acknowledgement of how hard testing is
  
  - write some units tests so we have a story around it
    - "we wrote unit tests"
    - we could talk about spin-up / tear-down to do QA
  
- CL: if that presentation to Nick was useful, we can do more
  - don't wait for Chris - if we want to present, just ask Nick and Max
  - prime Max - setup the meeting in advance
    - let him know what kind of presentation we've got and where his feedback should go

- lean on Max if we need anything
