## meeting w/ Chris
- CL:  thinking about - noticed there are a lot of questions around AWS
  - we could schedule a "review" with a bunch of people to help out (e.g., Chris Durand)
  - Ian Evans - also very good - very strong in that
  - there are a lot of people who might be able to help
    - if we have questions, we can set that up to get feedback
  - the longer we wait the harder it is to make changes
    - better to ask at 30% feedback - if we ask sooner, it may be better
  - if they're not caught up on RAG, it may make sense to practice our RAG pitch
  - if we want to do that, we can ask Max / Nick
    - could also ask Srdjan
  - Kevin was good as well - wasn't sure how deep Kevin might go.  he asked great questions

  - be aware of the delay in scheduling a session with AWS questions
    - you can ask staff first - they're ahead of us
    - we don't have AI architecture expertise - so CL will be interested to see what Max says
    - he may say expand scope - get additional features, etc.
    - wants to see how he feels about it

  - Kevin's comment - hit upon the main thing - he was impressed by our questions - asked about things that we shouldn't know to talk about
    - good to 'spar' with people - see where we sit
    - if we're outclassed, we need to know - we can postpone the job hunt so we're 'ready'

  - best to schedule in advance
  - CL: would like to see an aws review

  - CL:  any kind of review - if we've made a decision - we can do a quick review
    - we just want to test those decisions

  - people who are hands on will be able to catch stuff - hence it's best to ask them

  - library is often based on popularity
  - infrastructure choice often has more re-use
  - could Max about llamaindex selection as well - Kevin's answer wasn't super clear
    - we might not have made any mistakes on AI - it might be hard to make a mistake since everything is moving

  - JC:  code conformity
    - CL:  could use the same linter
    - pattern - there are project specific settings for style
      - may vary from project-to-project
      - could be low stakes (internal)
      - production systems (tight standards)
      - could also vary across languages
      - people might apply rules rigidly - but that isn't typically necessary
      - level of standards - use judgement
      - for us: use the same linting rules - write some unit tests that cover major cases, that's it
      - if we notice differences, just agree on an approach
        - it doesn't matter
        - "light awareness" is great
    - pay attention a little bit
      - don't have wildly different styles
      - follow LS core - it'll be fine
      - don't get fanatical

- CL:  wants a summary of how we feel
  - wants more commentary - needs to know what to do with stuff
  - JC:  we can do a traffic light - and also tell CL what he wants us to do - let him know what to do
    - let him know actions for him, and actions for us
    - he wants to know the path forward
