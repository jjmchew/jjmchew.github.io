## meeting w/ Chris

- CL: asked about video link
  - ask Max about the video

- CL: come Tuesday (move Monday meeting to Tuesday)
  - wants to see artifacts to review - wants to understand the current state
    - architecture - whats complete, whats not
    - where we're going

  - wants to get current state on Monday / Tuesday
  - we're in a long sprint
    - don't worry about code quality
    - finish this off

  - CLI thing - low risk - always been a nice to have (quality of life thing)
    - wants us to get it working, we can do it later
    - few people get it working
    - CDK

  - for non-tech people - RAG will be the main point of interest
    - if we're not too familiar, we need to articulate
  
  - if we don't use lambdas we need to justify it
    - can't justify it by saying it takes a week
    - could try dealing with architecture in a week - but it could take more than a week

    - we can rely on experts for lambdas

  - keep an eye on lambda work - work on it next week

- CL:  with Derick, give him the ideal architecture

- CL:  more worried about getting the architecture right, he can call people in other devs, etc.

- CL:  it's great to get experience doing everything - makes us flexible
