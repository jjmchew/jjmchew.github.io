## meeting w/ Chris
- JC:
  - server feels like a mess
  - CL:  be specific about what's going wrong
    - if you can't define what exactly is wrong, no one can help
    - need to protect your team from your feelings
      - if things are too far gone, then we could consider re-writing in another language
    - stay task focused

  - CL:  we should test end-to-end locally
    - is there a reason why we don't test end-to-end locally
  
  - TL:
    - talking about what might be wrong

  - CL:  how he works on LS.com
    - if you're working on a feature, you don't deploy it until it works locally
    - then you deploy to a staging environment
    - staging contains a subset of data from prod
      - then do more testing
    - it should be working as far as he knows
    - locally, he may not work with transactional email provider
      - locally, he uses a library to stub that out for testing
      - things should work end to end
      - it's not the real thing, but it's close
    - staging doesn't send emails either
      - it's hard-coded to only a few email addresses - only sends to Chris
      - now emails go only to Chris
      - now testing can be done in staging and emails to go Chris
    - then if everything works, then promote to prod
    - core feature needs to work locally before we go to prod

  - CL: server issues are staging environment
    - need to test everything locally before you move to staging
  - need to separate environment issues from code issues
    - it could be a logical errors vs environment issue
    - if we don't integrate 100% locally, it will make things harder

  - making it work locally as complete is ideal

  - environment issues - often are from different versions, etc.
    - check for local issues first
  
  - if it doesn't work locally, there might be too many issues remotely
  - if it can be integrated locally, then do it

  - if it's microservices, and you can't integrate locally, then it becomes tough
    - just slowly triangulate, but hopefully, each service is smaller - it should be easier to reason about


- CL:  could also use docker containers to spin up addition EC2 instances and make it "multi-tenant"
  - CL:  another capstone project
    - can be pulled up later - but it had everything on 1 ec2 instance, and then zoomed into the different parts of that ec2 instance

  - if we go down that road, we should split the db out
  - don't worry about architectural complexity - it needs to work first and foremost

  - most projects do not achieve idealized architecture
    - there's some adjustment and shifting of use case



- CL:  if stuff doesn't work on server, get it working locally
  - don't integrate all at once into server
  - if we integrate on the server, we need clearly documented contracts about how they talk to each other
  - get things to work locally

- CL:  fight the temptation to want to re-write things for integration
  - it's always hard for stuff to be written by different people and get integrated
