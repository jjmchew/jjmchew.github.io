- [ ] deploy into a sub-domain (e.g., `app.77345.site` or `api.77345.site`)


## DSA
- [ ] Ch7 ex 2:  is O(N+M) accurate?  It doesn't run through both sets of array elements in sequence, it's O(N) where N is the greater number of elements?  It total steps, it's O(N+M), but Big O is slightly different?
- [ ] Ch11 ex 5: couldn't figure this out on my own;  couldn't quite figure out the "sub-problem"
- [ ] Ch 12 fibonacci example:  the book version of memoization is less efficient than my version
      - is this b/c there are 2 calls to `fib` in the function?
- [ ] Ch 14 ex 5:  couldn't do this on my own - was circling around the answer, but didn't put it together
- [ ] Ch 18, ex 5:  didn't do dijkstra - related question since Nick indicated on slack that we won't cover dijkstra's in capstone


## Async JS
- [ ] custom generator code examples
