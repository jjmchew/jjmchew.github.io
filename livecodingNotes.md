good
- took time to think through problem
- looked at test case in detail
- using PEDAC process
- tested different approaches (irb to test sort)
- recognized confusion - good - recognized confusion with map
- recognized need to go back to algorithm

confused:
- 'iterator value'

suggestions
- deleted one of the '=' as part of the test case
- for PEDAC - stay method agnostic
- figure out key steps - tried to address many steps at once; e.g., sorting, counting, iterating, etc.  size of array vs info to find, etc.
- separate methods from desired output (e.g., tried to use map originally, but may not be necessary)
- worry less about time for practice?
- could better define what info is necessary (e.g., I wasn't sure why max_value was necessary)
- separate discrete steps to code later
- need to keep track of which arrays - i.e., sorted vs not sorted (may have been some syntax confusion)
- hardest thing might be not worrying about time - moving methodically

feedback for me:
- need to communicate more - not just talk out loud
- don't hack and slash - don't just 'try things'
- should know my methods pretty cold
- are we allowed to look up methods?  (e.g., each_with_index, each_index? )

awesome - building structure first
  - going back to different sections was great

caution:
- jump to conclusions on mutated string - don't think the problem defines that - could be either
- got hung up on pseudo code format - might need to work with it and find something consistent that you can rely on (might speed things up a little bit)
- watch out for zero-based indexes
- watch out for term 'mutated' - mutated involves changing the memory address?
- common patterns - always just .join(" ")
- think about why 1 approach vs another - with sample problems in lesson
- each doesn't mutate
- be careful what and where you print - at end of method it will change method output
