# Food guidelines for athletes

- carbs should be primary fuel source, generally 3:1 ratio (carbs : protein) [^1]
  - carbs are fast-acting, turn to energy relatively quickly; primary fuel source for the brain
  - carbs support protein synthesis, prevent breakdown of protein (as an energy source)
  - extra (immediately unused) glucose is stored as glycogen (energy reserve)
  - extra (unused) protein is stored as fat

- carb : protein ratio will vary depending on activity [^1]
  | Exercise type                | duration (min) | ratio   |

  | HIIT/interval training       | 45 - 60        | 2:1-3:1 |
  | strength training            | 30 - 45        | 2:1     |
  | strength training            | 45 - 60        | 2:1-3:1 |
  | **Everyday**                 |                |         |
  | low-intensity workout        | n/a            | any     |
  | outdoor running (mod int.)   | 45 - 60        | 3:1     |

- fats are also a fuel source when there is insufficient carb (glucose, glycogen) [^1]

- hydration:
  - Generally: if you weigh 200 lbs, need 100 oz of fluids / day (1 cup is 8 oz) [^1]
    - for 165 lbs person, need 83 oz ~= 10 cups ~= 2.6 L / day

- food generally takes 2 - 4 hrs to be completely empty from stomach [^1]

- before exercise:
  - 3 - 4 hrs prior, meal: focus on carbs, modest protein, low fat and fibre [^1]
    - quick-digesting carbs are better
    - low-GI (Glycemic Index) foods may be better
    - 2 - 2.5 cups of water [^1]
    - 2 hrs prior: drink water - 1 oz per pound of body weight [^2]
  - 1 - 2 hrs prior, snack: ~30 g carbs, less fibre, complex carbs okay [^1]
  - 30 - 60 mins prior, snack: quick-digesting carbs (e.g., toast, fruit, rice cakes, sports-drink, granola bar, crackers, pretzels) [^1]
  - 20 - 30 mins prior: 1 cup water (drinking slowly is better than fast) [^1]

- carb loading:
  - 6 days before event, start eating at least 5 g of carbs per kg of body weight
  - 3 days before event, start eating at least 10 g of carbs per kg of body weight; reduce exercise

- during exercise:
  - drink 4oz every 15 mins [^2]

- after exercise:
  - immediately after:
    - endurance athletes: eat 1.5 g carbs per kg body weight [^2]
  - within 30 mins after: at least 1 cup water [^1]
    - total fluid needs depend on many factors - rehydrate
  - within 1 hr after, snack: (e.g., eggs, yoghurt, hummus / bread, tuna / crackers, granola bar, cheese / fruit)
  - within 2 hrs after, meal: combo of carb, modest protein, little bit of fat [^1]
    - more fibre (whole wheat is better), protein, healthy fat
    - high-GI foods may be better
    - for endurance athletes:  additional 1.5 g carbs per kg body weight [^2]
  - water: drink 24oz per pound of body weight loss [^2]


- general meals:
  - focus on anti-oxidants, plant-based foods; don't worry about carbs : protein; don't limit fibre or healthy fats [^1]

- endurance nutrition [^2]
  - normal endurance sports : 7 - 10 g carb per kg body weight per day
    - for 165 lbs (75 kg): 525 - 750 g carb / day
  - off season : 5 - 7 g carb per kg body weight per day
    - for 165 lbs (75 kg): 375 - 525 g carb / day
  - during exercise : 30 - 60 g carbs per hour of exercise
  - protein: 1.2 - 1.4 g per kg body weight per day
    - for 165 lbs (75 kg): 90 - 105 g protein / day

- strength nutrition [^2]
  - normal strength sports: 6 - 10 g carb per kg body weight per day
    - for 165 lbs (75 kg): 450 - 750 g carb / day
  - activity lasting 4 hrs or longer : 7 - 11 g per kg body weight per day
    - for 165 lbs (75 kg): 525 - 825 g carb / day
  - off season : same as endurance
  - protein: 1.5 - 1.7 g per kg body weight / day
    - for 165 lbs (75 kg): 112.5 - 127.5 g protein / day
    - recovery: 0.1 - 0.2 g protein per kg body weight per hour
      - - for 165 lbs (75 kg): 7.5 g - 15 g protein
