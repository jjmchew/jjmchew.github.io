# RLC - pump track and trail course

## 1 Reactionary Body Suspension (RBS)
- bike around hitting obstacles and do nothing until after some external impact forces you to absorb the impact
- don't think about it as moving at a specific time or place, just let the terrain dictate the absorption required
- e.g., bike over curbs, roots, etc. let the impact of the tire on the obstacle dictate how you will absorb impact

## 2 Pump track
- drop in with pedals level to avoid pedal strikes
- brakes are for emergencies only (go at a speed that you can control w/o braking)
- keep pedals level at all times
- if you need to pedal, watch out for pedal strikes on higher rollers
- timing is more important than effort - exaggerating effort with bad timing will work against you
  - mis-timed inputs will slow the bike down
- initially, work on just rolling relaxed (not losing speed) - use reactionary body suspension to absorb the upslopes
  - keep shoulders, hips, hands relaxed and just roll
  - avoid body inputs other than those that just occur naturally
- don't over-think corners - use RBS on entry / exit rollers to avoid slowing down. Follow the line that feels most natural
- try and maximize how far you can roll after you start
  - move on when you can feel the rhythm of the track and can maximize your rolling distance


## Coasting corners
- height on berm will depend on speed, anything about the halfway height of the berm is reserved for higher speeds
- entering higher and exiting lower may be a good way to start if you're nervous
- stay relaxed
- keep line choice simple - parallel to painted lines at top of the berm is good
- lean bike / body as much as is comfortable based on experience and speed
- max grip is bike/body lean perpendicular to berm wall
- make a mental note of weaker side and aim to reduce imbalance
- remember to keep pedals level


## Pumping
- 2 parts:
  - downslope acceleration (make bike feel heavy)
  - upslope absorption (make bike feel light)
- can be done 'optimally' or 'sub-optimally' - both can work
  - sub-optimal occurs more naturally, but is less effective at higher speeds and on steeper rollers;  more likely from being self-taught
  - it is VERY EASY for the sub-optimal pattern to appear - resist the urge to pump multiple laps until you've drilled the right pattern

- optimal pump cycle:
  - dynamically **extend** on *downslope*
  - *coil* body on *upslope* (need to be able to hip hinge effectively)

- sub-optimal pump cycle:
  - *squat* on *downslope*
  - *stand tall* on *upslope*


## Hip hinge
- think chest down, butt back
  - weight transfer onto both tires is evenly distributed
  - end up with deeply bend arms and legs
  - shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, ankles all need to flex

- common errors
  - driving knees forward
  - jumping off the pedals when extending (standing up)
  - don't over compress the front fork (too much pressure on arms / hands)
  - shifting weight too far back

- practice drills
  - doing multiple hip hinges in a rhythm without resetting
  - doing a more energetic extension while taking care not to jump off the pedals


## Downslope acceleration
- need to enter the down in a coiled (hip hinge) position
- can only get acceleration out of the belly of the slope:  the slight curve right before the valley (trough) of the roller
- acceleration occurs as a result of a dynamic full-body extension of the body through the downslope, and especially the belly
- acceleration builds through the extension with power and speed peaking as they complete the extension right as the back tire finishes the last part of the belly before transitioning to the valle

### drill from flat approach to downslope (1 - 2 bike length is best)
- hip hinge as the bike rolls over the lip
  - keep body positioned perpendicular to bike - not too far back, i.e., arms shouldn't be too straight, think of hip hinge position practiced on flat ground
- extend once the back tire enters the downslope (bring awareness to where it is), extend dynamically
  - aim for the "buzzing" sound of acceleration as you hit the belly
- then use RBS to absorb any remaining rollers before getting back to roll-in

- should feel acceleration out of belly
- make sure you lock in that feeling of acceleration, tied to well-timed extension (minimum 20 times)

- the perfect valley width for this exercise would be where the front and back wheels bridge the distance between downslope and upslope of the next roller


## Upslope hip hinge
- if you're getting acceleration from downslope extension
  - now focus on increasing effectiveness of RBS with more reactive yielding - more arm bend, small amount of hip hinge
  - as front wheel rises up the slope, deepening the arm bend brings handlebars closer to the rider, deepening hip hing brings the rider closer to the handlebars
- really need to monitor (maybe with video) whether or not you are extending on down and coiling on up
- it can feel unnatural to get closer to the front tire on the upslope - avoid the urge to stand tall, it takes timing and commitment to perform


### add dynamism
- once you can do the pattern properly, work on adding more dynamism to movements:
  - more hip hinge on roll-in to downslope
  - more dynamic extension to belly to get more acceleration
  - more exaggerated hip hinge on upslope


### leap and absorb
- the ideal movement is to accelerate on the down and then 'leap' onto the top of the upslope, floating the bike up with you as you coil onto the top of the roller, ready to extend down the next one
- the faster the speeds, the more dynamic movement and range of motion are required
- the "leap and coil" is the crux of the pumping cycle and requires commitment from the rider
- aim for a 'floaty leapfrog motion', (aim for a moment of weightlessness atop the roller) make sure you're coiled on top of the roller, ready to start extension when the rear wheel reaches the downslope

- optical illusion:
  - it may LOOK like the rider is lifting bars towards hips and then punching them forwards (like a bunny hop), but the rider is leading the leap and the bike follows
    - definitely NOT a bunny hop - "leap and tuck" maybe (with forward momentum), whereas bunny hop is like a leap and jump
  - the rider gets out of the bike's way by maintaining a balanced body position on top of the bike as it changes pitch going up to level and then back down


## 2nd acceleration
- in order to get acceleration on the 2nd roller, 2 things are required
  - *must* be coiled sufficiently at the top of the next roller (you may think you are, but are shying away and standing tall)
  - you must wait for the rear wheel to reach the top of the roller
    - extending the rear into the upslope will slow you down!
- if the 3rd roller is close to the 2nd, timing on the extension down the 2nd roller must be short and precise - can be difficult


## Pumping straightaways
- once you can reliably get acceleration from 2nd roller, work on slowly adding more rollers, preferably on straights 
- the sub-optimal pattern is a constant risk - make sure you aim for  the right technique - coiling at the top of the roller extending on downslope and 'leaping' / coiling to top of next roller
  - if technique or timing fails, abandon the attempt and return to the roll-in - don't build bad habits


## Pumping the track
- you don't need to pump every feature - you can coast the awkward or hard ones and use RBS
- start by just pumping the easy features
- coast corners for now
- different cues may work to re-establish rhythm:
  - springing off belly
  - OR coiling at the top of the roller


## Bermed corners
- berms are like long rollers - the entry berm is an upslope, then a longer downslope to valley (trough) through the first half of the turn, then a longer upslope to the exit berm
  - need to extend through downslope, then coil to top of exit berm
  - timing can be tougher since it will be different than other features (e.g., may be longer)
  - remember to keep arms bent : if arms get straight, the bike is getting ahead of you and the front wheel will become light (can be sketchy, compromising front wheel grip and control)
